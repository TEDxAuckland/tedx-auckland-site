Tourist seems to be a gross word. I’ve travelled before, but it was on this particular trip that I realised this. *Too* touristy? I’ve only just started thinking about what that actually means.

My first experience of travelling in Southeast Asia happened recently when I visited Vietnam and Laos. I had an unforgettable experience embracing the new sights, smells, people and culture.

With only a limited amount of time in each country, I decided to visit some of the most popular places. To me, this felt like the safest way to get introduced to the country quickly.

In hostels, other travellers would talk about rejecting these places. And while I’ve made the same judgements in the past, now that I’ve been in these spaces, I’m curious to understand where this negativity comes from. &nbsp;

After spending some time thinking about it, I would say that there are 3 key reasons for this negativity.

#### Reason #1: Lack of authentic culture

There’s a common belief that visiting touristic areas leads to inauthentic cultural experiences.

I think it’s important to question why these touristic hotspots have become popular in the first place. In a lot of cases, they’ve become popular precisely because they are seen as cultural landmarks. Teaching people about the history of a place and how it has shaped its culture.

In Vietnam and Laos, I visited some incredible museums and temples, which helped me gain perspective of the culture. People are shaped by their history, to learn about it is to begin to understand the country as it is today. People know this, and so these authentic landmarks have attracted tourists. Despite being drawn to a different culture, these tourists bring with them their own, noticeably to the landmark’s detriment.

Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi are two of Vietnam’s most popular cities, so naturally, Western fast-food franchises were splattered around the city to cater to a tourist’s established tastes. I can get grotty Whopper Jr anywhere.

Unless the area was to be completely shut off from tourists altogether, along with the huge economic benefits they bring, it seems inevitable that this will happen.

In Bhutan, the government has been wary of the growth and development of tourism. In fact, the country has only recently welcomed tourists as recently as 1974. Before this, if you wanted to enter you needed the Government’s permission. This decision has proved controversial as commentators have become increasingly concerned about how this has and continues to impact the authenticity of their culture.

Should this process be resisted or accepted? I avoided most fast-food franchises as I wanted to experience the local food. Yet, I also accept that tourists visiting specific landmarks bring money, This does help the place prosper financially and of course that’s positive.

I do understand resisting when the increase in tourism doesn’t help the local economy. In Laos, I met another traveller who had just been through Cambodia. He visited the incredible temples of Angkor Wat and discovered that it’s being managed by a private company who aren’t putting profits back into Cambodia’s economy. He emphasised that if he'd known about the exploitative behaviour prior, he probably wouldn’t have visited.

The popularity of the place doesn’t change it from being great. I believe most of these places have become popular for a reason. Westernisation and financial exploitation are unfortunate byproducts of this, but I would have been upset if that had put me off, and I’d missed out on such enriching experiences.

#### Reason #2: Afraid of being scammed

In touristic places, tourists are often afraid of being overcharged and exploited for their money.

A friend of mine recently said that ‘meeting the locals’ becomes ‘beware of the locals’ because of how uncomfortable you can feel in these situations.

I saw a stark contrast between Vietnam and Laos in how they approached tourism. Tourism in Vietnam has been around for a lot longer than in Laos. This has allowed locals to observe the consumer behaviour of tourists for a longer period of time.

In the busiest areas Ho Chi Minh City, locals would aggressively attempt to sell their products or hand out flyers for massage parlours and restaurants. In Vientiene it was the opposite,I could move around without feeling pressured.

Vietnam is an example of why tourists reject these types of places and in some cases, tourism has brought out a negative side to local communities. Laos has shown me that tourism doesn’t necessarily have to be like this. However, this behaviour from Vietnamese locals didn’t have much of a negative effect on me. I see it as being just another interesting part of the travelling experience.

A highlight in both countries were some of the experiences I had with tour companies and restaurants. Sites like Tripadvisor have allowed for tourists to widely share their opinions, and this has encouraged locals to control the quality of their services to continue appealing to tourists. In some areas, businesses would display their Tripadvisor rating for all to see. Locals are acknowledging tourists concerns of being taken advantage of. I believe this is encouraging a healthier relationship between tourists and locals.

On Cat Ba Island, Vietnam, one tour company stood out from the rest. The owner personally showed my friends and I their rating, making them more legitimate and trustworthy. It’s great that local businesses are taking control of positive online reviews to attract credibility. After reviewing a few other companies in the area who did not greet us in the same manner, we chose them and had a fantastic boat ride through Ha Long Bay.

Locals pushing you to buy things can feel alarming, but I found that focusing on other aspects of the experience can help. The chaotic vibe of the people, noises and smells lifted my spirits. But this trip also shows me that we as tourists, should change our behaviour towards consumption if we want local communities to do the same.

#### Reason #3: Crowds suck!

An overcrowded place is unpleasant when other tourists behave in a disrespectful manner. In Vietnam, I visited the Củ Chi Tunnels , an area used by the Viet Cong to hide and plot against American forces. Some tourists were taking their picture and smiling in front of American war tanks, and others were shooting rifles on a firing range.

Similarly, in Laos, I witnessed an alms giving ceremony where monks walked the streets to receive food donations. Groups of tourists chose to use flash photography and kept talking during the procession.

I don’t think it’s appropriate to be acting in this manner. If anything it’s insensitive to the struggles experienced by the local people, and rude to traditional customs. It’s important to be a good tourist by behaving in a manner which respects these historical places.

I’d also hear tourists talk about not wanting to share a space which held too many other tourists. But I don’t think that’s a justified reason to reject those places. Other travelers have a right to experience the site, and sharing the space with others can add value to your overall experience. In the Củ Chi Tunnels I met some lovely travellers which added a positive spin to the uncomfortable tour.

I’m still glad to have experienced those tours as I connected with likeminded people, and reflected on how we ought to conduct ourselves in historically significant areas. It seems to me that it isn't the number of tourists which defines if tourism is negative, but the type of tourism.

#### So, how should we be *good* tourists?

When you think of a place as being “too touristy”, what does this means to you? I have touched on some of the negative aspects of tourism, but being a tourist in itself is not something to be viewed as negative.

My advice? Be open to new experiences, have cultural sensitivity, and some knowledge of the area - as this can help you to become a good tourist regardless of where you go. If you generalise tourism as being negative and forget to identify some of the positive aspects, you can miss out on some truly memorable experiences.
