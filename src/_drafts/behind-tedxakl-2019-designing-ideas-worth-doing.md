It’s 5.43pm. Warm rays flood the BizDojo lounge as crew and speakers trickle in one Friday afternoon. Our biggest event of the year - TEDxAuckland tūmanako - is quickly approaching, and the buzz is palpable in the room. Beers and banter flowing, speaker training resumes. Foraging for an angle, which wasn't hard to find. As soon as Angela stood up, design was on my mind.&nbsp;

Their industries are diverse, but their ways of working are converging. They’re working to understand and empathise with people - putting humans at the centre of decision-making, to design solutions worth doing.&nbsp;

Angela Lim, CEO of Clearhead - a mental health app - is first up rehearsing her presentation. Angela decided to leave general practice to develop the app when she became tired of being the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. In its first year Clearhead has already acquired users throughout regions across Aotearoa New Zealand. For those focussed on making a difference to all our people, not just those living in our biggest cities, this is a great success. In 2018 the OECD reported “regional disparities in health outcomes” in New Zealand as the “second largest among OECD countries, with Auckland ranking in the top 20% of OECD regions and Gisborne in the bottom 20%.” (Regions and cities at a glance 2018 - New Zealand https://www.oecd.org/cfe/NEW%20ZEALAND-Regions-and-Cities-2018.pdf). In Angela’s polished TEDx talk she reveals “I genuinely believe this \[regional success\] is from the co-design process”.&nbsp;

In another room, Tara Ranchhod is sitting down with Joseph Michael, Artist and TEDxAuckland Alumni, for an interview about his installation ‘Voices for the Future’ - a 40 story tall iceberg projection on the United Nations headquarters in New York (https://tedxauckland.com/an-interview-with-joseph-michael-art-environment-impact/). When asked about the purpose of his work, Joe explained that not many people get the opportunity to visit Antarctica so the environmental degradation can seem quite distant, but “when you bring the grandeur nature into an urban environment it’s quite powerful. Standing in front of that … seeing the enormity of this piece, the ice crashing off the side makes a tremendous impact, especially given that we’re also experimenting with sound.” He put the audience at the centre of this piece to create a moving, immersive experience.&nbsp;

Down in Wellington, Max Rashbrooke, Author, spends his time researching and writing from the perspective that successful societies are both economically and democratically inclusive. On the tails of another low voter turnout rate in New Zealand’s recent local body elections, Max brushed examples of everyday democracy across the stage.&nbsp;

By putting people at the centre of their work, these examples have all researched and discovered the key pain points of a system, and then designed a solution that really works to begin to solve them. Call it co-design, user experience design, service or product design - they’ve all used a process to discover the issue, define the problem, develop and deliver a solution.&nbsp;

This design process is commonly referred to as the ‘Double Diamond’ https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond - used globally by designers and non-designers “to tackle some of the most complex social, economic and environmental problems.” Originally developed by IDEO to… it has been used and referenced around the world.&nbsp;

The Design Council (UK) also highlights four principles to work as effectively as possible - put people first, communicate visually and inclusively, collaborate and co-create, and iterate.&nbsp;

…so are you working in a design-thinking way yet?
