*Around the world people are improving their ways of working - putting humans needs and behaviour at the centre of decision-making, to design ideas really worth doing. They’re working to empathise with customers, to truly understand problems that need solving, then develop and deliver solutions purposefully architected to make a difference. Here at TEDx, we too are listening, and it's exciting to hear across the diverse industries of our speakers that their processes are also converging - toward design-thinking.&nbsp;*

It’s 5.43pm. Warm rays flood the BizDojo lounge as crew and speakers trickle in one Friday afternoon. Our biggest event of the year - TEDxAuckland tūmanako - is quickly approaching, and the buzz is palpable in the room. Beers and banter flowing, speaker training resumes.&nbsp;

Dr. Angela Lim, CEO of [Clearhead](https://www.clearhead.org.nz/){: target="_blank"} - New Zealand's first app to diagnose and recommend mental health treatment - is first up rehearsing her talk. Tired of being the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff, Angela left general practice to develop the tool. In its first year the app has acquired users in regions throughout Aotearoa New Zealand - a great achievement, especially considering in 2018 the OECD reported “regional disparities in health outcomes” in New Zealand as the “second largest among OECD countries". While Auckland ranked in the top 20% of OECD regions, Gisborne came out in the bottom 20% ([*Regions and cities at a glance 2018 - New Zealand*, OECD](http://www.oecd.org/regional){: target="_blank"}). In Angela’s polished TEDx talk she reveals “I genuinely believe this \[regional success\] is from the co-design process”.&nbsp;

By putting people at the centre of their work, these examples have all researched and discovered the key pain points of a system, and then designed a solution that really works to begin to solve them. Call it co-design, user experience design, service or product design - they’ve all used a process to discover the issue, define the problem, develop and deliver a solution.&nbsp;

This design process is commonly referred to as the ‘Double Diamond’ https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond - used globally by designers and non-designers “to tackle some of the most complex social, economic and environmental problems.” Originally developed by IDEO to… it has been used and referenced around the world.&nbsp;

The Design Council (UK) also highlights four principles to work as effectively as possible - put people first, communicate visually and inclusively, collaborate and co-create, and iterate.&nbsp;

Down in Wellington, Max Rashbrooke, Author, spends his time researching and writing with the belief that successful societies are both economically and democratically inclusive. On the tails of another low voter turnout for New Zealand’s recent local body elections, Max brushed examples of everyday democracy across the stage. The ideas he discussed - citizens’ assemblies<br>participatory budgets, and online consensus - were solutions designed to engage humans behaviour. In an attempt to curb postal voting issues during Auckland's 2019 local body elections, we saw the return of pop-up polling booths at universities and night markets, [generating discussion on how local elections are run](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/400745/auckland-council-makes-last-ditch-appeal-to-voters){: target="_blank"}. Auckland's 2022 local elections are a prime candidate for a design-thinking reengineering.&nbsp;

…so are you working in a design-thinking way yet?
