Around the world people are improving their ways of working - putting humans needs and behaviour at the centre of decision-making, to design ideas really worth doing. They’re working to empathise with customers, to truly understand problems that need solving, then develop and deliver solutions purposefully architected to make a difference. Here at TEDxAuckland, we too are listening. It's exciting to hear across the diverse industries of our speakers that processes are also converging - toward design-thinking.&nbsp;

It’s 5.43pm. Warm rays flood the BizDojo lounge as crew and speakers trickle in one Friday afternoon. Our biggest event of the year - TEDxAuckland tūmanako - is quickly approaching, and the buzz is palpable in the room. Beers and banter flowing, speaker training resumes.&nbsp;

Dr. Angela Lim, CEO of [Clearhead](https://www.clearhead.org.nz/){: target="_blank"} - New Zealand's first app to diagnose and recommend mental health treatment - is first up rehearsing her talk. Tired of being the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff, Angela left general practice to develop the app. In its first year the platform has acquired users in regions throughout Aotearoa New Zealand - a great achievement, especially considering in 2018 the OECD reported “regional disparities in health outcomes” in New Zealand as the “second largest among OECD countries". While Auckland ranked in the top 20% of OECD regions, Gisborne came out in the bottom 20% ([*Regions and cities at a glance 2018 - New Zealand*, OECD](http://www.oecd.org/regional){: target="_blank"}). In Angela’s polished TEDx talk she reveals “I genuinely believe this \[regional success\] is from the co-design process”.&nbsp;

By putting people at the centre of Clearhead's design process, they have been able to understand the key pain points of a system, and then design a solution that really works to begin to solve them. In this case, they've called it co-design, but there are many names for similar ways of working, such as user experience design, service design, or product design, that can often fall under the umbrella of [design-thinking](https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

[![From challenge to outcome, Design Council outlines four key steps; discover, define, develop, deliver.](/uploads/double-diamond-model-design-council-2019.jpg "Double Diamond Model 2019"){: width="2400" height="1698"}](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond){: target="_blank"}

The Design Council (UK) offers a clear depiction of one design process coined the '[Double Diamond](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond){: target="_blank"}'. Used globally by designers and non-designers “to tackle some of the most complex social, economic and environmental problems," the Double-Diamond is a useful roadmap for those interested in trying a design-thinking way of working. Starting with the discovery phase to understand "rather than simply assume, what the problem is", we can then define the problem from insight gathered, develop various solutions, and deliver an outcome using iterative testing. They also provide more detail on design principles, methods, leadership and engagement which you can read more about on the [Design Council website](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

Down in Wellington, Max Rashbrooke, Author, spends his time researching and writing with the belief that successful societies are both economically and democratically inclusive. On the tails of another low voter turnout for New Zealand’s recent local body elections, Max painted examples of everyday democracy across the stage. The ideas he discussed - citizens’ assemblies, participatory budgets, and online consensus - were solutions chosen to engage human behaviour. In an attempt to curb postal voting issues during Auckland's 2019 elections, we saw the return of pop-up polling booths at universities and night markets, [generating discussion on how local elections are run](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/400745/auckland-council-makes-last-ditch-appeal-to-voters){: target="_blank"}. I think Auckland's 2022 local elections are a prime candidate for some design-thinking reengineering.&nbsp;

…so are you working in a design-thinking way yet?&nbsp;
