> How would you describe the show ‘I Am Rachel Chu’?

‘I Am Rachel Chu’ is a semi improvised, devised theatre show based off the book and film Crazy Rich Asians. We’ve rearranged the story, taken bits out, and have added our own personal stories into it.&nbsp;

The audience will get to re-experience the story of ‘Crazy Rich Asians’, but with these tangents and interruptions. Sometimes these interruptions aren’t just personal stories, but games (spontaneous theatre games). We also break the fourth wall by acknowledging and (at times) interacting with the audience.

> Why did you specifically choose to base your play off ‘Crazy Rich Asians’?

It seemed important because last year Crazy Rich Asians was such a big cultural phenomenon. Even people who aren’t plugged into the Arts (average consumers) were really aware of it.

**The reason it felt so relevant, and the perfect template for our show is because it's very existence questions Asian media representation.** It became the King or Queen of representation, and still is to an extent because it’s the largest Asian cast blockbuster in existence, in terms of *big hollywood scale*. So, there are all these conversations about what it did well, what it was representing, saying and doing for the community. In other words, as an all-asian cast did we feel represented in this piece of media and in asking that question, what sort of ideas, problems and conundrums do we come up with?

> Who are you representing in the story?

Asian millennials who are predominantly assimilated or westernized. We are telling the story of the average young Asian who has been born or raised in a western country. We’re not necessarily of high income, and predominantly work in the Arts so not the "model minority". We are the Asians you don't often get to see on TV, and probably meet in Auckland a lot of the time but don't see represented on our screens. We’re real people with real stories, which isn't to say that we don't overlap with stereotypes, we do and also don't. So we're like your Asian next door in a way.

> Why have you chosen to stage this show in Auckland?&nbsp;

I think it serves Auckland really well because this city is such a fascinating melting pot of culture. It's at an all-time high when it comes to the intersections between different POC communities and different POC artistic communities and I think very few cities in the world have the same level of cultural collision going on. It is intense and it's really beautiful and scary for a lot of people. I think it gives me a lot of life and you learn so much about people and yourself because of culture. So when youre in a city that is fertile ground for cultural investigation, diversity, and interrogation a work like this actually feels inevitable and I do think that maybe this work couldn't exist anywhere else. Auckland is a city that really speaks to Crazy Rich Asians and has a conversation with it. 'I am Rachel Chu' is a product of that conversation.

> Take us through the journey from the first version of the play at the Fringe Festival till now. How are you approaching the narrative the second time? Why is it different from the last time?

The first time was pretty rushed, stressful, and hectic. We would go through the book and film to figure out what the pivotal moments in the story were, and what our own versions of that were. For example, Rachel calling her mom in the movie became a game where one of the cast members calls their loved one. The actors were learning as it was being made, and never had much time to sit with the themes or ideas as much as we would have liked to.

The second time around we got funding and the big question was how do we deepen our own understanding of the text, games, and themes. We've gotten the actors to really question why their stories are valuable and what it is about their own stories they want to tell, even if the text isn't massively different. Hopefully their own understanding of it are what they bring to it is. The set design and design elements are slightly more polished and speak to the themes a bit more as well. The idea is&nbsp; that it's deeper, more meaningful, and makes more sense as a cohesive whole.

> Why did you choose these 3 actors to work?

I think their stories are as valuable as the Hollywood narrative that we're spoon-fed. And are good enough to actually be a Hollywood story, but just don't fit into the paradigms of what we expect. Ravi, Angela and Amanda are people that I recognise and know every day (not to say that they're not unique in their own way), they have so much character and personality. You have so many interesting quirks, nuances, and your life choices fascinate me and I think they bring that on stage with them, into the work. You watch them go "you are so extraordinary".

> What do you hope the audience takes away from this show?

The asians that are like us, are coming to the show because they're hungry for alternative versions of themselves. I hope they come away with it going. Yes. My story is valuable and actually maybe I will tell my own story and maybe what I see with something like crazy Rich Asians isn't the end game. It's just like the beginning and that's the thing, none of us involved in this process dislike the film,&nbsp; not actively I think some of us are kind of indifferent at worst.

But I think we can come away&nbsp; from it and go that's awesome. And it's doing a great thing. But this is just a small piece of the puzzle. There is so much to us there so many dimensions that are yet to be conveyed, or there's so many dimensions we are yet to see. I hope people come away going. Yeah. I can't wait to see more Asian stories and more different alternative Asian stories. We are sowing the seeds for that and that's quite exciting.

'I Am Rachel Chu' isn't the end of a conversation, its just the start of one, in the same way that Crazy Rich Asians is just the start of a conversation about the sort of work we want to see.
