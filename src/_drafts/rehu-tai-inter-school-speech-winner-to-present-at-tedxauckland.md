We are proud to announce our partnership with Rehu Tai Festival of Oral Language - an Auckland wide, inter-school speech competition. Established in 2015, Rehu Tai has just added the inclusion of 102 Flash Talks, Raps, and Spoken Word Poetry to the competition, and we can’t wait to hear what the kids will be presenting.&nbsp;

With the finals taking place on the 29th and 30th of October, and our next event, TEDxAuckland: tūmanako on November 16th, it only made sense that the Rehu Tai 2019 ‘champion of champions’ be given the opportunity to present their winning piece on the TEDxAuckland stage.

But this isn’t just an amazing coincidence, the relationship between TEDxAuckland and Rehu Tai goes back two years before the first Festival of Oral Language was held.&nbsp;

The original idea to evolution of the traditional speech competition for primary school students came at TEDxAuckland 2013, when co-organiser of Rehu Tai, Jane Bush was inspired by [Grace Taylor’s poetic talk on the power of words](https://youtu.be/LivPMiYik9g){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

It is an honour for us to help this initiative come full circle by hosting the Rehu Tai champion on our platform, and we can’t wait to hear all the incredible presentations that the tāmariki have to offer.&nbsp;

We will be announcing the winner of Rehu Tai on all our social platforms on October 30th, following the finals.&nbsp;
