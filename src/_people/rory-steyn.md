  *husband* / *father* / *security expert*


  After rising through the ranks of the
  South African police force, Rory was appointed to the Presidential Protection
  Unit in 1996, and was made team leader of President Nelson Mandela’s personal
  security detail, handling the protection of the former President both
  nationally and internationally.


  Rory watched Mandela, up close and personal, as he led the racially divided
  nation from the brink of bloodshed to unexpected levels of peace and
  stability.


  What Rory learnt from the man, once seen as a terrorist by South African
  authorities, changed his life forever.
