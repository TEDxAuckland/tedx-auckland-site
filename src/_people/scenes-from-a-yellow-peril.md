  Scenes from a Yellow Peril is the latest play by award-winning theatre-maker
  Nathan Joe, hot off the success of I am Rachel Chu. With equal parts anger and
  humour, this collection of provocations explores the complicated minefield of
  contemporary identity politics through an East Asian lens. An urgent warcry
  against everyday racism and systems of abuse.


  Nathan Joe will be joined by fellow trailblazers from Proudly Asian Theatre,
  Chye-Ling Huang and Marianne Infante, to bring excerpts from the play to life.
