  Dale is changing the way we connect online. Her #donate software, developed to
  make giving easy on social media, is unleashing the next generation of
  generosity. Her goal is to support the evolution of the human experience with
  money by creating a generosity-based financial system. A native Kiwi, her
  company GoodWorld is based in Washington DC.


  Prior to going to the United States, Dale ran Victoria University’s Center for
  the Study of Leadership. Her award-winning research took her to Harvard where
  she applied the theory of Allophilia to Maori leadership. This work
  demonstrates how the power of love and effective leadership can bring big
  diverse groups of people together.
