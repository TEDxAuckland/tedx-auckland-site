  Max Rashbrooke is a writer based in Wellington. His work is informed by a
  strong belief that successful societies are both economically inclusive – they
  share resources more evenly – and democratically inclusive, in the sense of
  ensuring greater participation in political processes. His writing appears in
  the Herald, the Spinoff and the Guardian, among others, and he was the editor
  of the bestselling book Inequality: A New Zealand Crisis. His most recent
  work, Government for the Public Good, is about the renewal of democracy in the
  21st century. He is also a Senior Associate at The Institute for Governance
  and Policy Studies at Victoria University of Wellington.
