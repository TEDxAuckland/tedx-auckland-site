  Having observed the shift from an economy driven by tangible to intangible
  assets (such as data, design, inventions, brands, software, and content), Paul
  grew frustrated about the missed opportunities by companies (and countries)
  not understanding how to identify, value and commercialise these critical
  assets. This frustration led him to establish EverEdge Global, an advisory
  firm that helps companies and capital providers convert intangible assets into
  business impact: increased growth, enterprise value and ROI.


  Paul has been named one of the top intellectual property strategists in the
  World for the last nine years consecutively by IAM Magazine, the world’s
  premier IP industry magazine. In 2012 he was awarded the Global IP Leader
  Prize at the Intellectual Property Focus Forum in Shanghai, China. He is a
  frequent speaker on commercialisation and innovation internationally.
