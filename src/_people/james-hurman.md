  James Hurman works at a crossroads of brand strategy, creativity and
  entrepreneurialism.


  A passionate believer in the power of creativity and storytelling in business,
  James’ personal purpose is to turn the theory into practice.


  His Auckland-based venture studio Previously Unavailable specialises in the
  rapid development of innovative products with non-traditional business models,
  helping companies big and small bring exciting new ideas into the world.


  He is the founder and CEO of Storytech, the world’s first ‘brand strategy in a
  box’ digital product, allowing start-ups and small businesses to develop a
  robust brand strategy for a fraction of the traditional cost.


  James’ prior career in the advertising industry was recognised with dozens of
  marketing effectiveness awards, and in 2013 he was named the world’s #1
  strategy planner.


  His 2011 book The Case for Creativity proved the link between imaginative
  marketing and commercial success and has been republished several times in
  multiple languages. His 2015 book ‘The Boy and the Lemon’ teaches kids how to
  be lucky, and is Kickstarter’s most funded New Zealand children’s book.
