  *Outspoken / Able / Driven*


  &nbsp;


  Grace Stratton, doesn’t pull any punches. Diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy at a
  year old, Grace has been navigating life in a wheelchair for nineteen years,
  but her disability isn’t the story, what she’s done with it is. At sixteen
  Grace built a website from her hospital bed while she was in recovery from
  surgery, that site led her to discover that in today's landscape; what made
  her different was what gave her power to succeed, in whatever fields she
  chose.


  &nbsp;


  Three years after building that website, this statement is still true. Grace
  defined her disability for herself, in a way which for the most part defies
  social convention, Grace saw her disability as something that would strengthen
  her in industry and as a person.


  &nbsp;


  Grace believes that all diversities hold this same strength, and that this
  should be self evident.
