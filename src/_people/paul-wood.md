  At the age of 18, Paul was a high-school dropout in prison for murder. While
  spending time in maximum security he discovered the life enriching quality of
  learning. This led him to voraciously pursue both formal and informal means of
  education. He acquired both Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Psychology and
  Philosophy whilst in prison and by the time he was released he was two years
  into a Doctorate in Psychology. Paul is now a respected coach and consultant
  who uses his knowledge and experience to assist individuals and organisations
  achieve their developmental goals. Paul will be using his own journey to
  illustrate and discuss the universal ingredients of successful personal change
  and growth.
