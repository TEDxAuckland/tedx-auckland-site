  Andrea Reid started a movement in New Zealand that aims to connect the city's
  parks, reserves and urban agricultural centres together to form Pollinator
  Paths. These paths will help bring crucial pollinators into our urban areas to
  enable our growing urban food network thrive.


  Andrea Reid has been working on this concept since early 2014. It started as a
  University thesis for her final year of a Bachelor of Landscape Architecture
  degree and has now grown in to a fully fledged movement.


  Andrea is currently collaborating with the Waitemata Local Board, Auckland
  Council, Auckland Transport, Gecko NZ Trust, For the Love of Bees, Kelmarna
  Gardens, several local community groups, sponsors & a bunch of passionate
  volunteers to create a series of prototypes to install throughout Auckland
  City starting in Grey Lynn. This project has won multiple awards and has been
  featured on Whanau Living, RadioNZ, NZ Herald, Stuff & the NZ Gardner
  Magazine.
