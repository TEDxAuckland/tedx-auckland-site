  Simon Che de Boer is a virtual reality content creator, renowned
  photogrammetrist, and founder of realityvirtual.co - a visual effects
  technology company streamlining real-world encapsulation - allowing them to
  deliver a true sense of ‘being there’.&nbsp;


  His work has received international recognition for the level of quality, and
  is commonly cited as the gold standard for photo-realistic digital-twin
  experiences. Forbes, NVIDIA, Autodesk and Epic Games have all featured the
  work of realityvirtual.co to demonstrate the potential of this new immersive
  medium.&nbsp;


  Simon’s real-world digitisation of sites of cultural significance span the
  globe - from King Tutankhamun and Nefertari's Tomb in Egypt, to local
  experiences for indigenous Māori in New Zealand, and other heritage projects
  such as New Zealand Parliament and the Treaty of Waitangi.


  Most recently Simon has been working on bleeding-edge AI to streamline deep
  learning techniques and set the stage for a visual effects automation
  revolution. These tools will aid in the digitisation of vast sites across the
  globe - a means to backup our planet.
