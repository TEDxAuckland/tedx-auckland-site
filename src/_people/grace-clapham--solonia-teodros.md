  *humanist* / *entrepreneur* / *cultural weaver*


  Solonia and Grace grew up as
  Third Culture Kids, products of an all-encompassing global culture that never
  stops evolving; citizens of a world where societal disruptions and sea changes
  are the norm. Yearning for a space in which transformation was encouraged they
  built The Change School to enable individuals to connect to themselves and
  each other – building upon a shared goal of self-realisation and the desire to
  make a positive impact on the global community.
