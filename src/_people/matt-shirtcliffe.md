  *mental wellness advocate* / *creative director*


  Father of two teens, awarded
  advertising creative director, ad agency owner, mountain runner, farm owner,
  poet, Christian. Matt was living a full and rewarding life last year when it
  profoundly changed last year. His wife of 17 years Mary, a farmer, died of
  depression.


  Searching for something good to come from his grief, Matt used his own
  experiences to speak out about mental health in the rural community. He wasnâ€™t
  prepared for the impact it would have or the enormity of the response. The
  journey since has reframed his own life in positive ways.
