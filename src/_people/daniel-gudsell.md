  *Entrepreneur / Wood Enthusiast / Amateur Linguist*


  Daniel Gudsell is a founding Director of New Zealand-based Abodo Wood - the
  leading proponent of wood modification technology in the Southern Hemisphere.
  In an industry where many exterior timbers are harvested from unsustainable
  old growth forests, or are treated with harmful chemicals, Daniel crafts
  timbers with lasting beauty that are safe for people and the environment. He
  believes in a world where sustainable, locally grown wood products can improve
  our lives and New Zealand’s carbon footprint. As a member of the International
  Research Group of Wood Preservation Daniel is connected with the world’s
  greatest minds in wood technology. Daniel has been a recipient of the Green
  Ribbon Award and the Sustainable Business Network awards in New Zealand, and
  is responsible for much of Abodo’s new market development and product design.
