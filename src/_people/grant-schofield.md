  Grant Schofield is Professor of Public Health at AUT, and director of the
  University’s Human Potential Centre.


  Grant’s career has focused on preventing the diseases of modern times, and
  seeing what it takes to help people live a long, healthy and happy life.


  He lives and breathes the motto “be the best you can be”, and sees this as a
  game-changer for the health system – capable of transforming the current
  deficit (sickness) model, to one in which we aspire to be well. He is
  redefining public health as the science of human potential; the study of what
  it takes to have a great life.


  Grant is well known for thinking outside the box and challenging convention
  wisdom in nutrition and weight loss, as well as physical activity and
  exercise.


  He is best known for his work in three areas: abandoning rules and embracing
  risky play in his free range kids work; leading public discussion in flipping
  the food pyramid, by challenging the low fat nutrition dogma with low carb
  high fat diets; and developing national accounts of well-being through his
  Sovereign Well-being Index research.


  His fluency across several scientific disciplines – from human physiology, to
  psychology, to pack performance – allows a new lens to be cast over old
  problems.
