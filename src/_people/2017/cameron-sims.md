  Cameron Sims believes the simple ingredient hemp, is the key to changing the
  world and helping humanity become more sustainable. As a Kiwi raised on a
  sheep and beef farm, he became New Zealand’s first hemp-based chef.


  Cameron’s company Plant Culture encourages and supports consumers to be
  environmentally friendly. His ultimate goal is to create a modern and
  biodynamic university campus to reintroduce biodiversity back into our cities
  and soils. Cameron’s passions are plant-based cuisine, art, nature,
  environmental enterprise, adventure, extreme sports, meditation, breathing,
  yoga and people.
