  *Mother / Victim / Cyclist*


    &nbsp;


  Sarah is in her 50’s and loves being outdoors combined with physical activity.
  She recently completed her first walking half-marathon preserving for a podium
  finish despite the blisters forming at the half-way mark. Cycling whether it
  be mountain biking or road cycling is also a keen pursuit. The outdoors
  provides Sarah with perspective and vitality.


    &nbsp;


  She kept a secret for 35 years from a traumatic event and broke her silence
  last years which led to a 9 month police investigation. The case was decided
  by the police that due to the lack of evidence it would not proceed to a court
  hearing. Sarah is confident that New Zealand systems and processes can be
  improved to make it gentler and safer for victims to share their secrets of
  historic abuse.


    &nbsp;


  Sarah works in a business environment having held a number of senior
  leadership roles in the public sector and self-employment in the
  rehabilitation industry. Sarah’s only child is now 30 years old. The strong
  relationship with her son, along with her husband, have provided the caring
  family support needed to help her navigate the previous year as a victim
  through the police investigation.
