  *Surgeon / Research Scientist / Medical Humanitarian*


  From a family of 13 children brought up in a village in Malaysia, Dr Tan
  completed medical training at Melbourne University in 1985 and subsequently in
  New Zealand where he qualified as a plastic surgeon. Following fellowships at
  Oxford and Harvard he became Hutt Hospital’s Director of Plastic Surgery in
  2000-2006 and Director of Surgery in 2007-2013.


  He founded the Centre for the Study & Treatment of Vascular Birthmarks in
  1996. Unsatisfied with the treatment for strawberry birthmarks he retrained as
  a scientist, receiving a PhD from Otago University in 2001. In 2013 he founded
  the Gillies McIndoe Research Institute, dedicated to relieving human suffering
  through paradigm-changing scientific research.


  Discoveries by Dr Tan’s team of the stem cell origin of strawberry birthmarks
  underscore the new low-cost treatment of this tumour using anti-hypertensive
  medications. Building on this work, cancer stem cells, the proposed ‘root’ of
  cancer, have been discovered in 14 types of cancer, leading to a novel cancer
  treatment using low-cost commonly available medications. A clinical study is
  now underway for patients with glioblastoma, a deadly brain cancer.


  Dr Tan has received many honours and awards, is a holder of six patents and an
  author of over 150 publications.
