  *Volunteers’ supporter / Respecter of the elderly / Cuddle bunny*


    &nbsp;


  Katie is the founder of the Kiwi Coffin Club (makers of fine and affordable
  underground furniture) A retired Nurse who in her career went from Midwifery,
  through the hoops to Palliative Care.


    &nbsp;


  She is pleased that a Coffin Club can provide , not only efficiency in
  construction of a coffin at an awesome price, but members (volunteers) that
  can give that special empathy (leavened with humour) to those confronted with
  their own mortality, be it diagnosed, pending or recent and to provide the
  means to use their own talents to enhance and celebrate their span on this
  planet of ours.


    &nbsp;


  She believes in the ongoing wellbeing and respect for the older generation in
  all aspects of their lives. Many are the volunteers that keep our communities
  viable. “Volunteers, The Heart of our Community – By many, the work will be
  completed, Mā tini, mā mano, ka rapa te whai.”
