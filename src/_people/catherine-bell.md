  Catherine’s mission in life is to inspire people to cook and eat simple, good
  food. A passionate foodie and Dish Magazine co-founder, Catherine is behind
  the Garden to Table Trust, a programme established to teach children aged 7-10
  years how to grow, harvest, cook and share food.


  The programme ticks all the boxes that Catherine feels are important in the
  world right now: caring for and about the natural world, knowing where food
  comes from and how to produce it, and knowing how to feed ourselves and our
  families.


  Catherine hopes that through the Garden to Table Trust, children can go up
  knowing the basic skills, reduce waste, eliminate plastic and chemicals, and
  eat only fresh food.
