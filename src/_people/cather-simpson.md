  Professor Cather Simpson, a physics and chemistry professor at the University
  of Auckland, wants to spark further innovation in our universities to boost
  economic benefit. As the director of the Photon Factory, she runs a high-tech
  laser lab which uses exotic pulsed lasers to help scientists from all realms
  and levels achieve their goals - whether to improve products in industry or
  even assist a science fair project.


  Currently, her lab is studying anything from how molecules light into more
  useful forms of energy, to how to better sort sperm by sex for industry.


  When she’s not enjoying using lasers to solve the knotty problems presented by
  Mother Nature, she’s doing puzzles with her partner Tom and being taxi-mom to
  two engaging teenage boys.
