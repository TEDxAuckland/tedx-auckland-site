  *Surfer / Environmentalist / Eco-preneur*


    &nbsp;


  Pete Ceglinski, the Aussie surfer who in 2015 successfully crowdfunded an
  invention designed to rid our waterways of rubbish. The Seabin Project went
  viral and has quickly become one of the most environmentally promising ways of
  turning the tide in our planet's war against plastics.


    &nbsp;


  It’s a rubbish bin that lives in the water of marinas and collects floating
  plastics, bottles, bags, oil, fuel and micro-plastics down to 2mm in size.


    &nbsp;


  Right now our business activities are 50% for profit and 50% not for profit.
  The reason for this is that we are in a unique situation where we have
  innovative technology to capture debris efficiently, but at the end of the
  day, Seabin’s are not the solution. Education, Science, Research and Community
  is the real solution, and so we have built this into our business model with
  growing success.
