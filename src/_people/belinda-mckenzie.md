  Belinda is a Mum, wine enthusiast and burns survivor. At 12 years old she
  received burns to most of her body, and her life took an unexpected and
  dramatic change. Through recovery she has mastered the art of reinvention,
  from navigating love and relationships, becoming a fashion designer, being a
  sought after speaker and an inspiration to other burns survivors. Belinda is
  an advocate for The NZ Burns Support Group - a network of support and
  practical help that improves the lives of burn survivors and their families.
