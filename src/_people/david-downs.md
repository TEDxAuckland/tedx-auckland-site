  *Genetically modified organism / Cancer conqueror / Author*


    &nbsp;


  David is General Manager at New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE), an
  ex-comedian, TV and Radio actor, a recent cancer conqueror and documentor of
  his battle with cancer in the popular column ‘A Mild Touch of the Cancer’ on
  NZ’s Stuff. David was given less than a year to live but managed to beat
  cancer in a remarkable series of lucky breaks. After a year of chemotherapy,
  and staring a terminal diagnosis in the face, David got a literal lifeline,
  with the chance to get on to a clinical trial in the USA. Now a genetically
  modified cancer-killing machine, David’s reflecting on the lucky series of
  events that saw him beat cancer, and on his new approach to life.
