  Nigel Parker is chief engineer for Microsoft Asia’s Commercial Software
  Engineering. His job is to seek out solutions to hard problems. But for him,
  it’s not just about the technology, it’s about the impact technology can have
  on people’s lives. In his own personal project, Nigel set about using
  technology to turn his health around and create better, stable habits.


  Nigel believes as machine intelligence becomes more developed, humans must
  make sure they keep up and build symbiotic intelligence to expand human
  capability in ways that are both tangible and magical.
