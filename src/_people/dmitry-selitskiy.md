  Dmitry is co-founder and CEO at Thought-Wired, an advocate for universal
  access for all and a believer in technology-enabled superpowers. He is
  passionate about creating technology that isn’t just cool but is useful and
  valuable to as many people as possible.&nbsp;


  In 2010 Dmitry built a proof-of-concept brain-controlled light switch in his
  living room, and then left his consultant / developer career to help his
  younger cousin, who is paralysed, to communicate with the world using this
  technology - starting Thought-Wired as a result.


  Thought-Wired’s mission is to create a world that is universally accessible to
  everyone at the speed of thought. They do this by translating brain and body
  signals into interactions with devices. Their first product - nous Blink - a
  wearable technology that enables someone who is paralysed or locked-in to
  control a computer using their intentional eye blinks, is already changing the
  lives of people around the world.&nbsp;
