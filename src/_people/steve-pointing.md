  Steve Pointing is Professor of Applied Ecology at Auckland University of
  Technology and director of the university’s Institute for Applied Ecology New
  Zealand. He pioneered the use of molecular techniques to understand how simple
  microbes cling to life in extreme environments such as the icy deserts of
  Antarctica, boiling geothermal pools and lakes that are ten times more salty
  than the ocean. This led to interest from NASA astrobiologists, those who seek
  to understand if life could exist beyond Earth, since the harsh conditions
  mimic those encountered on the surface of other planets. Steve has led an
  astrobiology research team collaborating with NASA for over a decade, and
  broadened his interests to consider the societal impacts of discovering life
  on other planets: How will this change our perception of humanity? What
  practical steps should we consider in preparation for this? Might we view the
  discovery of primitive and advanced alien life differently? What can we learn
  from our own historical interactions between first nation peoples and ‘alien’
  colonists?
