  Philip Patston is best recognised for his ten-year career as a comedian and
  entertainer, but itâ€™s his passion for social change that is getting him
  noticed. An alumni of the New Zealand Social Entrepreneur Fellowship, Philip
  is a passionate believer that we have a powerful opportunity to reimagine
  diversity. His focus is on engaging people to achieve positive social change
  by reinventing the labels with which we categorise ourselves and each other.
