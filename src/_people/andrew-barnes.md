  *Innovator / Entrepreneur / Philanthropist*


  Andrew has made a career of market-changing innovation and industry
  digitisation. Most recently, in New Zealand, he triggered a revolution of the
  entire fiduciary and legal services industries, and the transformation he has
  led as the founder of Perpetual Guardian has positive implications both
  locally and globally. This was evidenced by his announcement of the four-day
  week, which made headlines around the world reaching an audience of over 4
  billion people from 35 different countries and leading change in government
  thinking in the Europe, Australia and New Zealand.


  Andrew is a director of Complectus Limited, the company encompassing Perpetual
  Guardian and several other trustee businesses. He is the director of Coulthard
  Barnes, chair of the Regional Facilities Auckland board, and chairman of New
  Zealand payroll provider, PaySauce. PaySauce recently launched a new draw-down
  service to give employees interest-free access to money they have already
  earned as soon as they earn it, and is aimed at preventing people having to
  resort to pay day lenders (which charge up to 700% interest on small loans).


  Earlier in his career, Andrew identified the opportunity for the evolution of
  real estate in Australia and was chairman of realestate.com.au at the time of
  its IPO on the ASX. Later, he became CEO of Bestinvest, a UK-based investment
  management and advisory company, leading the sale to private capital in 2007,
  and was managing director of Australian Wealth Management Limited, a major
  Australian wealth management and trustee business that he led to IPO in 2005.


  Andrew is a sought-after keynote speaker and is regularly asked to address
  audiences internationally on subjects as diverse as governance, philanthropy
  and business, leadership, entrepreneurship, team culture and change management
  topics.
