  Michael is the founder of Indigenous Growth – a new organisation with a
  quadruple bottom line - which feeds his passion to empower families like his
  to get themselves out of the poverty cycle.


  Since 2005 he chose a specialised path dedicated to this goal of serving his
  family and families like his. Indigenous Growth takes a culturally diverse
  approach, building their people from the grassroots level to provide a more
  diverse and profitable culture for all organisations.


  Mike holds a number of governance and advisory roles for Whanau Organisations,
  Charities, Learning Institutions and Not for Profit organisations.
