  *entrepreneur* / *student* / *environmentalist*


  Georgia is trying to change
  the way we look at sustainability. Her award winning research into the
  applications of aquaponics won her the Prime Minister’s Future Scientist
  award, and at the age of 18 she started her own business, Root Aquaponics,
  where she hopes to start selling aquaponic units she designed to homes and
  schools in New Zealand.


  An environmentalist at heart, Georgia has led sustainability expos to educate
  others on the importance of future proofing today’s industries, and has been
  invited as a guest speaker at community events. Georgia hopes to challenge the
  way individuals and companies look at adopting sustainable approaches to both
  production and living.
