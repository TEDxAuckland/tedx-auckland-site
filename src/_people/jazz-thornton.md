  *Co-founder / Advocate / Director*


    &nbsp;


  Having overcome childhood abuse and multiple suicide attempts, Jazz Thornton
  has now dedicated her life to speaking hope and creating change in the area of
  mental health through her organisation Voices of Hope. Her unique experience
  and practical message has gained worldwide recognition, being shared through
  media, international speaking engagements and now through a new feature
  documentary film. Living by the saying “it’s not about battling your past but
  fighting for your future” Jazz believes that no matter what your going through
  it is possible to get through when you learn how to stop surviving and start
  fighting. In 2017 Jazz was named New Zealand’s youngest director to win the
  annual Doc Edge pitching contest and is now directing her series The Silence
  Project which aims to shed light to the stories behind our suicide statistics
  while changing the way we have conversations about it.
