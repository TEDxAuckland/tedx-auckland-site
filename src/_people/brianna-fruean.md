  Brianna Fruean is a Climate Change Activist, who has been leading grassroots
  community projects pushing for climate justice since learning about the
  effects of climate change and noticing the subtle changes to her island of
  Samoa as a child.


  At age eleven, she became a founding member of the Samoan chapter of the
  climate organisation 350.org, and the youngest 350.org country coordinator. At
  sixteen she became the youngest winner of the prestigious Commonwealth Youth
  Award for her environmental activism. At seventeen, Brianna was chosen by the
  Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme as their first
  ever youth ambassador in recognition of her efforts to include young people in
  the environmental conservation space.


  Now twenty-one years old, Brianna is a proud Climate Warrior residing in New
  Zealand, while studying at The University of Auckland. She sits on the Council
  of Elders for the Pacific Climate Warriors as the youth representative and
  continues her efforts to bring young Pacific voices into the climate
  space.<br>&nbsp;
