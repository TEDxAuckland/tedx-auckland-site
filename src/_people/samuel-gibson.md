  *adventurer* / *entrepreneur* / *wheelchair designer*


  Born with a rare
  condition called Osteogenesis Imperfecta and has broken nearly every bone in
  his body.


  Wheelchairs and broken bones are part of life for Samuel, though for those who
  know Samuel, ‘Disabled’ would one of the least appropriate words to describe
  him. World traveller, Adventurer, Entrepreneur, Husband, Father of two
  gorgeous little girls - Samuel considers himself the luckiest boy in the
  world.


  Samuel is part of a wheelchair design partnership that is changing the lives
  around world in the most practical way. Physical independence is something
  Samuel is very passionate about and sees it as one of the most basic of human
  rights.
