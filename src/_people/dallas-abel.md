  Dallas Abel is the Project Manager of The Kai Ika Project, a non-profit
  initiative that recovers previously unwanted fish parts and shares them with
  people who truly appreciate these delicacies.


  As an ex-Fisheries Observer with the Ministry for Primary Industries, he has
  seen first hand the result of fisheries mismanagement. This experience, along
  with his background in Marine Science, motivated Dallas to pursue a career in
  fisheries advocacy and public awareness with LegaSea.


  He enjoys sharing his knowledge and educating people on how they might
  contribute to restoring the abundance of our inshore marine environment. With
  Kai Ika he is able to be the positive influence needed to help people better
  respect and utilise the fish we are taking, fostering improved behaviours that
  will allow us to take less.


  Dallas loves everything about fishing and spearfishing, from being able to
  hunt and gather for his young family to simply observing a fish in its natural
  environment. He believes restoring marine abundance starts with public
  awareness and not being afraid to challenge the status quo.
