  Dr. Angela Lim is a Paediatrics Doctor turned CEO and co-founder of Clearhead
  - New Zealand's first AI driven diagnostic and triage platform for mental
  health and wellbeing. She believes technology has the potential to deliver the
  transformative change required to improve health outcomes. Clearhead aims to
  improve mental health access by providing choice, convenience and control
  directly to the user.&nbsp;


  Angela graduated from the University of Aucklandâ€™s medical school and started
  paediatrics training at Starship Hospital, but her passion for tackling
  inequality led her to take a break from clinical practice in order to focus on
  developing scalable innovative solutions in health. She has been involved in
  multiple research projects including during her sabbatical at the Harvard
  School of Public Health, which resulted in publications in international
  peer-reviewed journals.&nbsp;


  Angela is also passionate about good governance solving complex problems, and
  sits on multiple boards for the New Zealand Government and not-for-profits.
  She is currently the chair of the 20/20 Trust.


  As a finalist in the 2017 Young New Zealander of the Year Awards, her
  leadership has been widely recognised.
