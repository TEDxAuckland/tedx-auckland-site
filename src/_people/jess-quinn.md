  *Storyteller / Life-Liver / Survivor*


  Jess Quinn has a passion for helping people overcome adversity and insecurity
  using her own experiences. Since losing her right leg to cancer at the age of
  9, Jess has refused to let that stand in her way of living life to its fullest
  with a core passion for helping others overcome their physical and mental
  setbacks along the way.


  Jess has developed an social media following of 180,000+ followers by speaking
  of her journey in a raw, honest way. Having just placed third on Dancing with
  the Stars NZ and signing with a LA based modelling agency, Jess has turned her
  adversity into a career of helping others push through life’s triumphs and
  continuing to lead by example by taking all challenges that come her way.


  As one of New Zealand’s most engaged personalities on social media, Jess
  connects with thousands of people each day to help inspire their own journey.


  Jess is currently on a mission to bringing awareness to image retouching in
  the advertising industry and why we are chasing an unachievable and
  unrealistic idea of perfection both as a model and advocate.
