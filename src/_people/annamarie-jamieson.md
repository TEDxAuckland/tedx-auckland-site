  Annamarie is an executive leader with over 20 years’ experience across a broad
  range of roles.


  Common to them all has been Annamarie’s ability to foster employee engagement
  while improving business performance. Currently the People & Culture Director
  for [Stuff.co.nz](http://stuff.co.nz/)


  She is deeply committed to enabling people to lead rewarding lives and wants
  all of us to recognise the potential for everyone to contribute to society.


  Diversity and an inclusive workplace and high on her agenda and she has
  launched an award-winning programme at Stuff, the Creative Spirit programme,
  which is about giving young adults with intellectual disabilities a chance to
  contribute to society in a meaningful way. This was followed by an inclusive
  initiative, The Coffee CO-OP – Stuff’s Auckland office cafe which is staffed
  by deaf baristas. Staff use sign language to order their coffees and in
  CO-OP’s opening week, Under Annamarie’s guise, Stuff received the 2017
  Attitude ACC Employer Award, and in the same year was a Diversity and
  Inclusion Leadership Award Finalist.


  She also won Fairfax Media’s inaugural Women of Influence Community Leader
  award in recognition of this work, which supports the employment of people
  with disabilities.


  She firmly believes that everyone has the right to contribute to society, to
  follow a passion and to be connected to our communities in some shape or form.
