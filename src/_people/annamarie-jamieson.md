  Annamarie firmly believes that everyone has the right to contribute to
  society, to follow a passion, and to be connected to our communities in some
  shape or form.


  In her position as the People & Culture Director
  for&nbsp;[Stuff.co.nz](http://stuff.co.nz/){: target="_blank"}, she launched
  and implemented the award-winning&nbsp;*Creative Spirit programme*, which
  gives young adults with intellectual disabilities a chance to contribute to
  society in a meaningful way.


  This was followed by&nbsp;*The Coffee CO-OP*, Stuffâ€™s Auckland office cafe,
  which is staffed by deaf baristas. These programs and the many benefits that
  have arisen not only to the employees, employers but to the community have
  been immeasurable.
