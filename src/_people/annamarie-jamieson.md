  Annamarie firmly believes that everyone has the right to contribute to
  society, to follow a passion, and to be connected to our communities in some
  shape or form.


  In her position as the People & Culture Director for
  [Stuff.co.nz](http://stuff.co.nz/), she launched and implemented the
  award-winning *Creative Spirit programme*, which gives young adults with
  intellectual disabilities a chance to contribute to society in a meaningful
  way.


  This was followed by *The Coffee CO-OP*, Stuff’s Auckland office cafe, which
  is staffed by deaf baristas, and received the *2017 Attitude ACC Employer
  Award*, and in the same year was a *Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Award*
  Finalist.


  She also won Fairfax Media’s inaugural *Women of Influence Community Leader*
  award in recognition of this work, which supports the employment of people
  with disabilities.
