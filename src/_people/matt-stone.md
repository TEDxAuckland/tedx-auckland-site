  Arguably one of the hottest chefs on the Australian dining scene, it’s not
  rare for foodie fans of Matt’s to book tables 3-months in advance at
  Sydney’s&nbsp;*Stanley St. Merchants*&nbsp;where he’s head chef, or queue 100m
  down the street at&nbsp;*Greenhouse*, a Perth eatery which was named
  Restaurant of the Year in 2010.


  Matt’s an Aussie that’s serious about food and sustainability - if it can’t be
  sourced locally, it’s not on the menu.&nbsp;*Greenhouse*, Australia’s first
  all-recycled restaurant is a place where foodies can touch natural materials,
  understand where everyday fresh food comes from and taste food straight from
  the garden.


  When Matt’s not in the kitchen, he’s a regular face on TV and billboards,
  enthralling audiences on MasterChef Australia, Iron Chef Australia, and on his
  own TV show,&nbsp;*Aussie Recipes that Rock,* a series that is aired in over
  40 countries.
