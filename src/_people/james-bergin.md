  James is the Chief Architect at ASB
  bank and father of three young children.


  As a father, James has a keen interest in financial literacy and the challenge
  of teaching new generations about money. He believes that as money becomes
  less tangible in our digital world, we need to find new ways of using
  technology to impart good money habits to our kids in order to increase their
  financial well-being.


  At ASB James is helping the 168-year-old bank to rethink itself as a tech
  company, licensed and trusted to provide financial services.
