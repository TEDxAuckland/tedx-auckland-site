  Chris is an electrician by trade, but his real passion lies in helping people
  lead more creative lives. As the founder of Humans of K Road and now Humans
  for the Future, Chris focuses on bring humans from all walks of life together
  to share sustainable ideas and pursue their creative endeavours. His
  exhibition Creative Mirror is currently touring the world, inspiring people to
  unleash their inner creativity, by connecting them to different artists and
  opening up the art world.


  Chris also founded the Crisp Creative Club in Australia, which holds sessions
  to help others improve their creative mindset. As the author of The Creative
  Soul, Chris believes “If it's the journey, not the destination, then we may as
  well make the journey as creative and colourful as possible”.
