  Lisa King is on a mission to ensure no child goes to school hungry. As a
  mother of young children, she couldn’t fathom that 28% of Kiwi children go to
  school without lunch. So, with 15 years experience marketing some of the
  country’s biggest food brands, Lisa founded Eat My Lunch. She aims to show
  that clever business solutions can solve big social issues. For every lunch
  purchased, Eat My Lunch gives a lunch to a Kiwi kid in need. In the first 2
  years, Eat My Lunch has given over 450,000 lunches to kids from low-decile
  schools across the North Island.


  Eat My Lunch has been the recipient of numerous awards including three Westpac
  Auckland Business Awards in 2016, Deloitte's Fast 50 Rising Star 2016 and
  2017, TVNZ Marketing Awards 2016, and Lisa was awarded a Women of Influence
  Award in both 2016 and 2017.
