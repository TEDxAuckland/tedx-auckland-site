  Sam Stubbs is the founder of non profit KiwiSaver fund Simplicity. Sam’s
  career spans politics, philosophy, technology and finance. He believes the
  finance industry should be as much a force for good as a source of profit
  which he thinks can be achieved by companies embracing long term thinking,
  sustainability and full diversity.


  Sam’s primary passion is being the best son, partner and dad and he will most
  likely be found on the water trying ski, surf and sail.
