  Jahra ‘Rager’ Wasasala is an award-winning cross-disciplinary artist of
  Fijian/NZ European descent. As an artist, Jahra investigates her ancestral
  connections through the art mediums of performance activation, contemporary
  dance and poetry, and has extensively toured her performance works both
  nationally and internationally.


  As a child of the Pasifika diaspora, Jahra is invested in translating her
  shared internal conflict into an accessible, yet confrontational, physicalised
  language. Her most recent performance work titled “a world, with your wound in
  it” focuses on the complex relationship between the earth and a woman’s body,
  a theme Jahra continues to investigate in her developing work.


  Jahra is known for her transcendent performance presence, otherworldly
  physicality and potent poetry, as well as her bold approach to political and
  social themes both on and off the stage. Jahra found her voice through the
  physical arts and believes that they are intrinsically tied to reclaiming
  autonomy, reconnecting to your ancestors and changing the world around you.
