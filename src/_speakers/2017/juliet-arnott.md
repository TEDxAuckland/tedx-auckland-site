  Resourcefulness is at the heart of Rekindle. Juliet Arnott, occupational
  therapist and craftsperson, founded Rekindle in 2010 to confront wastefulness,
  and ended up being confronted with a lot more. Juliet's practice is inclusive,
  often inviting the community to become makers, and to transform those
  under-valued material resources around them, and in doing so to value their
  own inner resources. She works to acknowledge human wellbeing as inextricably
  linked to our active care of the world around us.
