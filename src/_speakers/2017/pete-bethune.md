  Pete Bethune takes conservation to the extreme. As the founder of Earthrace
  Conservation, Pete is a world record holder, circling the globe four times on
  his powerboat Earthrace. His missions have seen him shot at, run over by a
  Japanese security vessel, incarcerated in Libya and Japan, and held under
  armed guard in a Guatemalan Military camp.


  As the producer of his show ‘The Operatives’, Pete runs a team of former
  special forces operatives to combat wildlife poaching, smuggling and illegal
  fishing in Africa, Asia and Central America. He also works closely with
  government enforcement units training them in coastal surveillance and hostile
  vessel takedown. At the heart of it all, Pete is a ship captain with an
  environmental edge.
