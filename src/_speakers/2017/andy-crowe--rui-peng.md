  Andy co-founded Critical. Design in 2013 with Rui Peng, aimed at democratising
  manufacturing. The Design Lab is located inside decile 1 Wesley Intermediate
  School and brings tech such as 3D design and printing, robotics and CNC
  milling to their students and community. Andy has supported innovative
  initiatives in the education sector and continues to help teachers to think
  outside of the box to best prepare students for an unknown future. He has
  harnessed this experience to drive the social innovation initiatives that
  Critical pursues.


  Rui Peng is a husband, father, social entrepreneur, designer, maker,
  architect, technology enthusiast, and a man with a big mission. The question
  that guides his work and life is: ‘How can I align my deepest desire with the
  world’s deepest need?’ As a young designer based in the low socioeconomic
  neighbourhood of Mt Roskill, he is searching for the “sweet spot” where his
  talents can be directed towards empowering his neighbours to gain the skills
  and resources they need to determine their own futures. He co-founded
  Critical. Design in 2013 and right now, he’s working through the immense
  challenges that come with making the dream of the social entrepreneur a
  reality.
