  For David Razowsky, all that matters is now. The respected Los Angeles-based
  improv guru has performed and directed in 10 Chicago Second City revues with
  the likes of Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Rachel Dratch and Amy Sedaris as
  well as being artistic director of The Second City Los Angeles for a decade.
  David’s philosophy is this: Your present awareness is the only thing you need
  to create compelling, smart, truthful, and surprising scenes. No games, no
  preconceived premises, no ideas, no ego.


  As well hosting a weekly drop-in class when he’s not taking his improv around
  the world, he hosts the podcast ADD Comedy with Dave Razowsky. He is a
  consultant for Dreamworks, a teacher for Steppenwolf Theater, professor for
  California State University, and he directed two productions for Amsterdam’s
  Boom Chicago Theatre. David’s also a member of the Reduced Shakespeare
  Company.
