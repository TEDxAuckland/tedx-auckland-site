  Julie has dedicated the last two decades of her life to changing the world and
  enriching peoples’ lives. She is perhaps best known for transforming the lives
  of thousands of young people with disabilities and their families, through
  StarJam, the organisation she founded and led for 12 years. Julie has been
  recognized widely for her twenty years of charitable work. Amongst accolades
  received in a variety of award programmes, she was named Supreme Winner, NEXT
  Woman of the Year in 2012 and appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of
  Merit in the Queen’s Birthday Honours in 2013. Building on her successful
  track record and the social change models she has created, Julie is excited to
  be unleashing SOUL.
