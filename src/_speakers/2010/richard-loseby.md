  The rise of content creation, e-commerce platforms, digital tagging and social
  media are the new norm. Mindful consumerism is on the rise. AR and VR
  technology continues to astound in terms of what it can bring to the retail or
  brand experience. But in reality, what I see every working day, is that the
  power of a good advertising idea still reigns supreme. Happily, I know a bit
  about coming up with them. I also know how to inspire others to do the same -
  creating the kind of campaigns that, no matter where people see, hear or touch
  them, are still impactful and effective. I am in the business of storytelling,
  and as the head of Pixar once said, 'Fancy graphics might keep them
  entertained for a few minutes, but it's the story that keeps people glued to
  their seats.'
