  Alistair Knott is a linguist and cognitive scientist working at Otago
  University‘s Department of Computer Science. He grew up in Brussels, attending
  the European School, a multilingual institution whose Babel-like environment
  sparked a lifelong interest in language. Ali studied psychology and philosophy
  at Oxford University, and then did postgraduate and postdoctoral work in
  artificial intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. He took up a
  lectureship at Otago in 1999, where he is now an associate professor. Ali’s
  research is in computational modelling of human language, with a focus on
  models of language generation. He worked on some of the earliest text
  generation systems deployed on the World Wide Web, and on an influential
  web-based human-computer dialogue system. His current interest is in
  psychological models of text generation: What are the neural mechanisms which
  allow people to talk about what they see and do?
