  Assil Russell is a young dental surgeon from Hamilton who has a passion for
  helping others. Born in Iraq and raised in New Zealand, at the age of 21 Assil
  set up New Zealand’s first and only registered medical and dental charity for
  Iraqi orphans and disadvantaged children – I CARE (Iraqi Children’s Aid &
  Repair Endeavour). Assil believes that “You don’t have to be a doctor to save
  lives” and ICARE is now an international movement that is empowering ordinary
  people from all walks of life to make a real difference, one smile at a time.
