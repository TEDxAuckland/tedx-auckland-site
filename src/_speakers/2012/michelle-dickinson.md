  Michelle has a PhD in biomedical materials engineering, runs New Zealandâ€™s
  only nano-mechanical testing laboratory and is a self-confessed adrenaline
  junkie. Her passion for both sports and science has enabled her to travel the
  world on the search for her next adventure or research project. With
  specialist knowledge in nanotechnology, Michelle has contributed to the
  development of cutting edge technologies. Secretly, however, Michelle has been
  working on advancing these developments to help her to achieve her childhood
  dream of becoming a real life superhero. In her spare time you will usually
  find her outside kitesurfing, cycling, running, paddle boarding, or inside
  practicing martial arts. Her recent move to academia from industry was a step
  towards her goal of inspiring females to push the boundaries in both science
  and sports, and to encourage environmentally sustainable living through
  engineering design.
