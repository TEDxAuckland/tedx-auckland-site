  Sam was born in 1946 and grew up in Castor Bay, Auckland. It was a coastal
  childhood filled with poems. Both parents and their colourful circle of family
  and friends often had poems on their lips – usually told from memory. The
  Catholic Mass made its mark on Sam too.


  Though he likes to call his poems “songs for the tone-deaf”, Sam has happily
  worked with musicians – country band The Warratahs, modern classical man
  Gareth Farr, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and alternative rocker David
  Kilgour, among others. Sam was special guest at two acclaimed Leonard Cohen
  concerts in 2009. In 1986, Sam was awarded a QSM – a “quiet sober man” he
  claimed. In 2010, he was further festooned with honour when he was made a
  Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (CNZM) for services to poetry.


  Sam has enjoyed a burst of activity in recent years, publishing a new
  collection of poems Doubtless and the semi-autobiographical Backroads:
  Charting a Poet’s Life, as well as a selection of James K. Baxter poems. His
  most recent book is Knucklebnes: Poems 1962 – 2012.
