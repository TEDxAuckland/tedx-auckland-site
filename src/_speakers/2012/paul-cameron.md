  Paul has always had a passion for technology and reading and finds it
  fascinating that we can now carry an entire library around in our pocket. Yet
  the reading experience has not evolved in more than 2000 years despite
  storytelling taking disruptive leaps forward with the introduction of film and
  video games. Booktrack is his answer to addressing the decline in reading and
  literacy rates that will help make reading relevant again to a new generation
  of readers. Prior to Booktrack, Paul flew with the Royal New Zealand Air Force
  in roles including fisheries and customs surveillance, search and rescue, and
  anti-terrorism. Paul then founded a new division of an electronics and
  software company that provides products and services to the global defence
  industry, before cofounding Booktrack.
