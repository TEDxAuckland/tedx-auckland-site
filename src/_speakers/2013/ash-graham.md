  Ash didn’t choose music, it chose him, and lucky for us it did. His songs show
  a maturity that is quite beyond his 18 years. His new EP Sixth Street Soul
  will be released in July this year shows a new and developed progression in
  his music, and has seen him working with the likes of Andrew Spraggon (Sola
  Rosa). He has already won a myriad of competitions, supported a wide range of
  artists from I am Giant to Anna Coddington to Shihad. His songs have placed in
  song writing competitions nationally and internationally, and he’s playing the
  big NZ festivals (R n V, Blues and Brews) His music has a hook that keeps you
  wanting to come back for more.
