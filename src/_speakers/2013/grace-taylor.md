  Grace Taylor is a spoken word poet, teaching artist and youth development
  worker. She believes in the empowerment of words, in particular through
  creative manifestations and providing spaces for people to tell their own
  stories. Graceâ€™s poetry ciphers strongly around dialogues about identity, with
  her believing that the exploration of a sense of belonging is underestimated
  in many facets of society. Grace is co-founder of the South Auckland Poets
  Collective and the Rising Voices Youth Poetry Movement.
