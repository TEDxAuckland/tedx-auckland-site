  Pete Russell is a local food advocate, social entrepreneur and founder of
  Ooooby. After seeing first hand the destructive nature of globalized food and
  the accelerating demand for local alternatives during his time at a
  multi-million dollar food business, Pete became committed to working in the
  local food space. Driven by a passion for developing smart systems for food
  sales and logistics, Out of our own backyards (Ooooby) is the result of his
  work – a local food operation delivering to hundreds of Auckland doorsteps
  each week.
