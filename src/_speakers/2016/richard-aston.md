  *social entrepreneur / rebel / optimist*<br>Richard put his IT and business
  skills to good use when he bailed out of the corporate world and took over the
  reins of Big Buddy in 2002. It’s taken focus, will-power and trust to grow an
  organisation that matches male volunteers with fatherless boys.


  But Richard’s source lies in the values of the hippy movement he grew out of -
  his strongest belief is around the strength of human caring; he believes
  passionately that most anyone and anything can be healed when humans step up
  to care deeply for each other without judgement or expectation.


  Richard is also chair of Consumer NZ, a Vodafone World of Difference award
  winner and is a passionate father, grandfather, celebrant, gardener and
  author.
