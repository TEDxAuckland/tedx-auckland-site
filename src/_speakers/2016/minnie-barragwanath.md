  Minnie is CEO and co-founder of Be. Accessible, a social change agency that is
  shifting how Kiwis value accessibility and the contribution to our world by
  people with access needs. This vibrant and innovative approach to social
  change has caught the attention of government, business, entrepreneurs and
  communities throughout New Zealand and the world. At itâ€™s heart Be. Accessible
  is moving the emphasis from a notion of disability to Poss-ability, from
  deficit to strength, from disempowerment to leadership! Values of creativity,
  positivity, flexibility and generosity are at the heart of this social
  movement and underpin the work of Be.


  Minnie was a recipient of the Sir Peter Blake Leadership award 2013 and was
  made a Member of the NZ Order of Merit Queens Honour in 2014.
