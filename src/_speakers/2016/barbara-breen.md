  *conservationist* / *geographer* / *social ecologist*<br>Barbara is a senior
  lecturer in the School of Applied Sciences at Auckland University of
  Technology and has over 20 years’ experience working in government and NGO’s.


  Her research and personal interests are in geography, ecosystem management,
  cultural landscapes and spatial ecology. Her research focus has been the
  identification, selection and management of Protected Areas, using geospatial
  sciences and novel remote sensing technology, such as drones, to map habitats
  and landscapes for conservation planning.


  Barbara's work has taken her to some of the world's most remote and unique
  ecosystems including desert systems in both Antarctica and the Namibia. She is
  a self confessed techno-nerd and is an advocate for the effective use of
  drones for good in NZ and beyond.
