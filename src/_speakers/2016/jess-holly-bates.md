  *artist* / *critic* / *auntie*<br>Jess is a theatre practitioner,
  vulnerability junkie, writer and artist, who loves to communicate cultural
  criticism through performance.


  She investigates the way our bodies behave in social relations, particularly
  in relation to our ongoing colonial hangover in New Zealand. In 2014 her
  acclaimed solo theatre show Real Fake White Dirt, (Best Writing NZ Fringe
  2015) was published as a book of poetry by Anahera Press.


  She believes that the only way to acknowledge our difficult history is to lean
  into the real discomfort of being Pakeha. Her 2016 work The Offensive Nipple
  Show is a collaborative body project responding to the dangerous ways gender
  politics are disconnecting us from one another. Through performance, she seeks
  to find new ways of looking at each others bodies, that are both cheeky and
  empowering.
