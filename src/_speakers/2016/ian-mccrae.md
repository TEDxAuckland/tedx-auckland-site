  *founder* / *engineer* / *lapsed* *mathematician*


  Ian began his professional career employed as a scientist writing mathematical
  models of the human body, before moving into the commercial world. In 1993 he
  founded Orion Health with a team of just four people and has grown the company
  to over 1250 staff in 27 offices worldwide, enabling healthcare to more than
  90 million patients worldwide.


  Ian is passionate about the role that technology can play in enabling highly
  personalised care for individuals through the practice of precision medicine -
  using personal healthcare information that is captured and made available in
  real time. This technology will transform the practice of medicine into a
  mathematical science, and for a lapsed mathematician like Ian that means the
  health sector just got a whole lot more interesting.
