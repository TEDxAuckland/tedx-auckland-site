  *mental wellness advocate / creative director*<br>Father of two teens, awarded
  advertising creative director, ad agency owner, mountain runner, farm owner,
  poet, Christian. Matt was living a full and rewarding life last year when it
  profoundly changed last year. His wife of 17 years Mary, a farmer, died of
  depression.


  Searching for something good to come from his grief, Matt used his own
  experiences to speak out about mental health in the rural community. He wasn’t
  prepared for the impact it would have or the enormity of the response. The
  journey since has reframed his own life in positive ways.
