  *charity founder* / *mentor* / *adventurer*


  Jayne has been described as many things; a brave adventurer, a visionary, an
  infectious truth-teller, a teacher, a mentor and an encourager.


  She has experienced bible smuggling into China, overland trucking in Africa,
  micro lighting over Victoria Falls, bathing elephants in Nepal, hot air
  ballooning in Cappadocia, walking part of the Camino de Santiago, trekking in
  the Himalayas, and horse riding in Turkey, Argentina and the length of New
  Zealand.


  In 2011, Jayne started her new adventure, a charity called Project Moroto
  which provides safe dormitory living for orphaned girls in Moroto, Uganda. She
  has provided a haven for 20 gorgeous girls, but what Jayne is most passionate
  about is giving these girls a "go"- an opportunity to find and fulfil their
  potential.
