  *māori showband / contemporary / indigenous entertainment company*<br>The
  suave crooners from the award-winning Modern Māori Quartet invite you to enjoy
  a fresh take on the classic Māori showbands of yesteryear.


  Toi Whakaari: New Zealand Drama School alumni James Tito, Maaka Pohatu,
  Matariki Whatarau and Francis Kora bring the concept of a Māori Rat Pack into
  the present with a contemporary twist, weaving their acting and musical
  talents together to fuse hearty and humorous Māori storytelling with the
  glorious tradition of showband entertainment.


  Modern Māori Quartet blends old school charm with modern pizzazz to highlight
  Aotearoa New Zealand's musical past and present, featuring unique spins on
  Māori waiata (song), showband hits and pop music, all infused with the
  multi-talented Māori foursome's irresistible charisma, sublime harmonies and
  universal humour.
