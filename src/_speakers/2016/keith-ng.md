  *data nerd / journalist*<br>As a young man, Keith dreamed of being a
  hobo-journalist - seeing the world and telling stories while living out of a
  sack. But what started out as a naive warzone adventure turned into lifelong
  vendetta and alternative funding model for independent journalism.


  It has been almost a decade, and these days Keith does data visualisation
  consulting to fund his journalism projects, with the thought of sustainable
  crowdfunding just over the horizon. The independence from self-funding
  ("Batman journalism!") creates a wonderful and dangerous space for innovation,
  disruption, getting lost and going crazy. If heâ€™s lucky, one day, it might
  even allow him to live out of a sack.
