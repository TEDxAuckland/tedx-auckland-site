  Natural, cheeky and straight-up South African-born, New Zealand-based, Urzila
  Carlson, took to the stage for the first time in 2008, and has since racked up
  an impressive array of awards for her stand-up comedy.


  Some of the awards she holds to her name include Best Female Comedian at the
  2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 NZ Comedy Guild Awards, as well as the coveted TV3
  People’s Choice Award at the 2013 New Zealand International Comedy Festival.


  She has also had 4 sold-out solo seasons (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013) at the New
  Zealand International Comedy Festival, and was invited to Melbourne
  International Comedy Festival in 2013 where she had a hugely successful
  sell-out season and appeared on the televised Oxfam Comedy Gala and Comedy Up
  Late.


  Urzila is one of New Zealand’s funniest comedians, male or female, and is a
  true star on the rise.
