  Muskan Devta is a bright, bubbly, and brave fourteen-year-old who has achieved
  much in her short life. Muskan was born with a medical condition called
  partial hemiplegia. Her right side is weaker than her left and for 13 years
  she had to wear a brace to keep her foot straight. Being a special needs child
  gave her a lot of challenges, but Muskan proved that she could overcome them
  by focusing on the positives.


  Coming to New Zealand at age 4, Muskan is currently a student of Westlake
  Girls High School. She has been an radio host, column writer and author of two
  books, including her autobiography written to raise funds for Starship
  Hospital; the book ‘I Dream’ is now part of her school’s Year 9 curriculum.
  With the support of her family, school, and hospital, Muskan is very
  successful today. She is on a journey to make people realise that being a
  child with a disability does not mean you are different.
