  Leaving New Zealand in 1996 to go on his big OE, John returned to New Zealand
  with an exciting idea - to set up an interactive percussion business for the
  corporate events industry. In 2003 Rhythm Interactive was born, and it has
  grown to become one of the most innovative, interactive, and entertaining team
  building shows for the conference and events market in New Zealand.


  Since then, John has travelled throughout Australasia and Asia performing for
  thousands of people of all ages.


  In 2009, the show won the category of Best Nationwide Corporate Entertainment
  at the Corporate Events Guide People’s Choice Awards.
