  Vivien is the co-founder of the exciting Loomio Cooperative, an organization
  born from activists in the Occupy movement collaborating with Enspiral, the
  social enterprise network. Vivian is passionate about working with other
  people to find scalable solutions to the wicked problems of our time: poverty,
  equitable access to education, clean water, and sustainable local economies.
  She brings experience in decision making, social change and a depth of
  knowledge in organisational systems.


  Vivian believes a whole new set of opportunities for the world arises from the
  intersection of online citizenship and democracy. Her personal mantra is that
  ‘a group of people with diverse experiences and perspectives will come up with
  solutions better than any one person ever could have’. Vivian is inquiring
  into the nature of collaboration, into the power of the crowd, and what
  invites people into engaged citizenship.
