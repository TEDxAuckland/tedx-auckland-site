  After losing her daughter Evie, who had a rare chromosome condition, award
  winning NZ Wedding and Portrait photographer Rachel Callander turned her
  talent to capturing the beauty and abilities of other children with ‘Super
  Powers’.


  Rachel has traveled the length and breadth of NZ meeting ordinary families
  being made extraordinary through the journeys their children are taking them
  on.


  As a result of her travels, Rachel’s insights and images offer a fresh
  understanding and language regarding disability. The stunning photographs of
  the children alongside the conversations with their parents are presented in
  the Super Power Baby Project, a photographic art book due for launch in August
  2014.


  The Super Power Baby Project is a life affirming work. It does not shy from
  the notion that genetic syndromes bring with them their share of challenge,
  grief and difficulty. The strong message is though that there is much that
  lies beyond that. Rachel demonstrates that these children have much to teach
  us about themselves and ourselves, which is to be celebrated as truly
  exceptional.
