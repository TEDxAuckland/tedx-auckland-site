  *entrepreneur* / *weirdo* / *technologist*<br>Vaughan is the Founder of Vend,
  a cloud based retail software for small to medium retailers worldwide. The
  Vend team hold three core values dearly in their hearts; to delight retailers,
  to do the impossible, and to take care of one another.


  Vaughan also co-founded OMG Tech! an initiative to encourage kids of all
  backgrounds, genders, and ages to get into technology. It not only covers
  coding, but all newly developed technology such as robots, drones, nanotech,
  teleportation and hover-boards. They give kids the chance to explore and get
  inspired by technology that they will be experts in ten years from now.


  He dreams big and likes to set himself impossible challenges; whether it is
  cycling the length of New Zealand solo, running 1,000 kilometres, or building
  a $100M venture.
