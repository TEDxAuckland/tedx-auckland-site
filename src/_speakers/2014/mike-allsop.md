  Air New Zealand pilot, Everest mountaineer, adventurer and extreme marathon
  competitor, Mike is an ordinary family man proving that anybody can accomplish
  extraordinary things.


  Life took a dramatic turn when a flight from the USA to New Zealand led to a
  crash-landing into the sea off the coast of Hawaii in the dark of night. The
  US Coast Guard colonel who eventually rescued Mike and his crew commented that
  nobody else had ever survived a crash landing into that part of the ocean.


  As well as becoming an Air New Zealand captain, Mike harboured another
  ambition – to stand at the top of Everest and, true to form, he conquered this
  goal in an unguided expedition. He has since gone on to conquer numerous other
  mountains, narrowly dodged a fatal avalanche in Peru, risked being shot in
  Russia, and returned a replica of a stolen Yeti hand to a monastery in Nepal.
  He’s also one of a handful of athletes who have ever run 7 marathons in 7 days
  on 7 continents.


  Most recently, Mike returned to the Himalayas to run the world’s highest
  marathon around Everest. This was a feat never before attempted and a
  milestone that was captured in the documentary film Chasing Altitude showing
  that others too can achieve their dreams and ambitions by overcoming the fear
  of failure and breaking each goal into a series of smaller steps.
