  Dr. Hong Sheng Chiong is currently an eye doctor in Gisborne hospital. He was
  trained in Ireland and was awarded the medical degree MB BCh BAO. He also
  obtained a postgraduate training in ophthalmology (PGDipOphthBS) from
  University of Otago and is currently a Master's in ophthalmology research
  candidate. He completed his clinical training in Ireland before he crossed
  over to New Zealand where he initially worked as a registrar in neurosurgery
  and general surgery before he stepped into the world of eye. His main
  interests are eye regenerative medicine, bioengineering and telemedicine. His
  exposure to third world medicine in Kenya, Nepal and Malaysia have given him
  the insight to the burden of preventable blindness. He believes the problem
  lies in the access to quality eye care. In 2014, he founded OphthalmicDocs, an
  R&D company that focuses on the development of ultra mobile and economical eye
  tests and diagnostics devices. He has invented several eye imaging adapters
  that can be used in conjunction with a mobile application to diagnose and
  monitor eye diseases. Fighting preventable blindness is his career's primary
  mission.
