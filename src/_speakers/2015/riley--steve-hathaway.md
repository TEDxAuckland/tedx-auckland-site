  Riley Hathaway is a passionate 14-year-old ocean ambassador, who is already
  presenting her own TV series called ‘Young Ocean Explorers’. In Young Ocean
  Explorers, Steve and his daughter Riley present a captivating series of
  stories about what happens when a teenager comes face to face with the marine
  animals we’re all curious about, such as stingrays, orca, and turtles. It’s a
  winning combination: Riley’s got the questions and the teenage-cred, and
  Steve’s got the boat and underwater know-how. Together, they take us on a
  journey that has never been previously imagined: a fun, accessible glimpse
  into the world of New Zealand’s incredible underwater species.
