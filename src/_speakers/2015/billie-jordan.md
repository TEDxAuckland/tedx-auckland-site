  After narrowly surviving New Zealandâ€™s deadliest earthquake in Christchurch in
  2011, Billie Jordan felt there was more to life than working as a
  communications consultant for large corporations. So she quit her job and
  moved to a small island off the East Coast of Auckland in New Zealand. Once
  there she taught herself how to dance following hip hop clips on YouTube, then
  gathered up her elderly neighbours (aged 68 to 96 years old) and established
  them as a hip hop dance crew with the audacious goal of performing at the
  World Hip Hop Championships in Las Vegas within eight months. From that point
  on her life and the lives of her dance group changed forever.
