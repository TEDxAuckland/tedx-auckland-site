  A futuristically classic sound in a distinctive blend of funky drum rhythms
  and soulful synthesizers – that is how you can explain the diverse music mix
  of Sorceress. The duo has evolved into a widely respected soul electronica act
  with a truly global following. The band is formerly known as Funkommunity,
  founded in 2011 by vocalist Rachel Fraser and producer Isaac Aesili. Their
  debut album ’Chequered Thoughts’ was internationally acclaimed and Sorceress
  spent 2012 touring Europe and Japan. Their success and exploration of new jazz
  inspired sounds resulted in the new album ’Dose’ in 2014, which was nominated
  as finalist for Best Electronica Album at the 2014 NZ Music Awards. This year
  the duo are embarking on a new international tour, so be ready for one of New
  Zealand’s most exiting soul acts to give you an irresistibly tuneful surprise.
