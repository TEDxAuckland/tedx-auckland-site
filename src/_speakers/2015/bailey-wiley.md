  Few artists come new to the game with such a fearless and complete approach to
  music. Bailey Wiley filters neo-soul classicism through modern, righteous and
  true live musicianship. The star of the show is her golden voice – effortless
  and organic, supported by her raw talented band. Her debut record “IXL” is
  made in collaboration with polyglot beatmaker and producer Swaren Veygal and
  features six original cuts from two of New Zealand’s most exciting new
  talents. Live on stage is where Bailey belongs. Having already shared the
  stage with the established and the up-and-coming, she’s setting her sights on
  more solo shows. At the moment she is a part of the successful collaborative
  Fly My Pretties, while she is working on her new solo album and preparing
  herself for her upcoming summer tour. Do not miss the chance to see a true
  star on her way up!
