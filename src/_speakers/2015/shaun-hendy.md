  Shaun Hendy is the founding Director of Te Pūnaha Matatini, a Centre of
  Research Excellence hosted by the University of Auckland. Shaun is an advocate
  for multi-disciplinary research and teaching, and lectures in the University
  of Auckland’s Department of Physics and the University’s Centre for Innovation
  and Entrepreneurship. His interest in innovation led him to co-author the 2013
  book, “Get Off the Grass” with the late Sir Paul Callaghan. Shaun believes
  that the challenge for New Zealand - if we want to base our economy on
  knowledge rather than nature - is to overcome our relatively small and widely
  dispersed population base and build a city of four million people. To do this,
  we'll need to start trusting each other more so that our ideas will spread,
  and we'll need the infrastructure that connects us. If we can do this it would
  make us one of the most innovative places on the planet.
