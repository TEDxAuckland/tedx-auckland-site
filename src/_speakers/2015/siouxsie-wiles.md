  Award-winning scientist Dr. Siouxsie Wiles describes herself as a
  microbiologist and bioluminescence enthusiast but to others she is “that
  pink-haired science lady”. With a PhD in microbiology, Siouxsie heads up the
  Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland. After recently
  becoming a parent, Siouxsie has realised that sexism and gender- stereotyping
  prevails even in the simplest Lego toys. She believes that playmakers like
  Lego should lead the way in stamping out this gender-stereotyping in toys,
  with easy fixes like producing mini-figs with double-sided heads: one male,
  one female, letting children decide who they want them to be, regardless of
  their roles. For Siouxsie it will, at the very least send out the message that
  everything is possible and that means everything would be awesome.
