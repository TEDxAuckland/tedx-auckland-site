In this day and age, setting goals is considered a necessary life skill in order to be successful, or at least, what society deems successful. Instead, Chris Pemberton encourages you to focus on making the journey of life a colourful one and to create the mental space needed to open your mind to its infinite possibilities, as opposed to staying single-mindedly focus on one track. This way we can make sure all of the goals we are heading towards are in line with what drives us intrinsically. Chris believes the way to achieve this mindset is by exploring one's creativity. He shares his story of coming to this realisation, and the art projects he dived into that helped him discover the depths of his creative expression... and a psychedelic experience involving Ayahuasca. With an international experiment called Creative Mirror, Chris proves creativity exists in everyone, no matter their skill level. Chris is an electrician by trade, but his real passion lies in helping people lead more creative lives. As the founder of Humans of K Road and now Humans for the Future, Chris focuses on bring humans from all walks of life together to share sustainable ideas and pursue their creative endeavours. His exhibition Creative Mirror is currently touring the world, inspiring people to unleash their inner creativity, by connecting them to different artists and opening up the art world.

Chris also founded the Crisp Creative Club in Australia, which holds sessions to help others improve their creative mindset. As the author of The Creative Soul, Chris believes “If it's the journey, not the destination, then we may as well make the journey as creative and colourful as possible”. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
