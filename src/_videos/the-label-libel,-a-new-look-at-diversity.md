Watch As Love Draws Near by Philip Patston here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZPxTPr5MRw

Philip Patston is best recognised for his ten-year career as a comedian and entertainer, but it's his passion for social change that is getting him noticed. An alumni of the New Zealand Social Entrepreneur Fellowship, Philip is a passionate believer that we have a powerful opportunity to reimagine diversity. His focus is on engaging people to achieve positive social change by reinventing the labels with which we categorise ourselves and each other.
