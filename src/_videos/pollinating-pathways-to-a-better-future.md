Andrea Reid is on a mission to create connected ecosystems across urban landscapes where pollinators can thrive. In this talk she describes how we can help inspire and support a clean and green climate-ready future, full of locally sourced food, in which people can feel a real connection to the land.

Andrea collaborates with a wide range of local Council and Community groups in order to create these Pollinator Paths that help bring crucial pollinators into urban areas enabling our growing urban food network to thrive. This aims to connect the city's parks, reserves and urban agricultural centres together. To learn more, collaborate or donate visit [pollinatorpaths.com](https://www.pollinatorpaths.com/)
