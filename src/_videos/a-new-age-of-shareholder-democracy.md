Sam Stubbs, CEO of online-only, nonprofit investment fund, Simplicity, charts the rise of the modern corporation, and a new era of shareholder activism and social change. Sam looks at how being a conscious consumer can and has changed the way corporations run themselves for the better, taking power away from some of the most significant businesses that influence our society, and giving it back to the people who should. Sam Stubbs is the founder of non profit KiwiSaver fund Simplicity. Sam’s career spans politics, philosophy, technology and finance. He believes the finance industry should be as much a force for good as a source of profit which he thinks can be achieved by companies embracing long term thinking, sustainability and full diversity.

Sam’s primary passion is being the best son, partner and dad and he will most likely be found on the water trying ski, surf and sail. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
