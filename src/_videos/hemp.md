Why is something as useful as hemp so underutilised in so many developed countries? How can we use this “companion plant” to benefit society? Founder of the hemp seed food product company, Plant Culture, Cameron Sims explores these questions, detailing the history of hemp prohibition, and how this has held society back from being more sustainable. Cameron lists the many benefits and uses of hemp, from eating it for breakfast to building environmentally friendly houses, showing us how we can begin harnessing the power of hemp pragmatically in order to improve our own lives and the world around us.    Cameron Sims believes the simple ingredient hemp, is the key to changing the world and helping humanity become more sustainable. As a Kiwi raised on a sheep and beef farm, he became New Zealand’s first hemp-based chef.

Cameron’s company Plant Culture encourages and supports consumers to be environmentally friendly. His ultimate goal is to create a modern and biodynamic university campus to reintroduce biodiversity back into our cities and soils. Cameron’s passions are plant-based cuisine, art, nature, environmental enterprise, adventure, extreme sports, meditation, breathing, yoga and people. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
