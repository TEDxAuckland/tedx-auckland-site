This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Luke turned his back on a successful advertising career to follow his passion for making things. His TV idea is now a worldwide success.

Adman-turned-filmmaker Luke Nola is founder of Luke Nola & Friends, an Auckland-based production company that creates and produces award-winning television formats that inspire, engage and educate kids all over the world.

One of the most enduring formats produced is Let’s Get Inventin’, a multi-award-winning reality TV series featuring kids aged 8-14 years with amazing invention ideas competing to build their contraptions.  The series is enjoyed throughout the world, screening in over 73 countries and is the first New Zealand children’s TV format ever to be licensed by the BBC in the UK.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
