Plastic in our ocean is a complex issue but it is not rocket science. The change we want to see starts with ourselves because there is no magic bullet or an overnight fix. Ocean Plastics can be solved by accepting responsibility for our own actions and using both Reactive and Preventative Solutions in parallel, in fact, the most gimmicky and fantastical ideas the better. The Seabin Project is just one example of this. [\#saveourseas](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23saveourseas) Pete Ceglinski, the Aussie surfer who in 2015 successfully crowdfunded an invention designed to rid our waterways of rubbish. The Seabin Project went viral and has quickly become one of the most environmentally promising ways of turning the tide in our planet's war against plastics.

Itâ€™s a rubbish bin that lives in the water of marinas and collects floating plastics, bottles, bags, oil, fuel and micro-plastics down to 2mm in size.

Right now our business activities are 50% for profit and 50% not for profit. The reason for this is that we are in a unique situation where we have innovative technology to capture debris efficiently, but at the end of the day, Seabins are not the solution. Education, Science, Research and Community is the real solution, and so we have built this into our business model with growing success.&nbsp;
