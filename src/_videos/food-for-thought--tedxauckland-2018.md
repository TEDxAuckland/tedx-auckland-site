Look back at the food and drink set-ups that brought the good vibes and sustenance all day for attendees, volunteers and crew at TEDxAuckland 2018: Off-Piste. Auckland's festival of ideas isn't limited to the talks, and the innovative vendors of our 2018 event are proof of that. In this video, Sour Heart Productions (https://bit.ly/2Eonfj3) highlights some of the great foodies doing great things.
