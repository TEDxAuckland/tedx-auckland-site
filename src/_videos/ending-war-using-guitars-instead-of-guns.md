A civil war you've probably never heard of, and the peace mission that successfully ended it. Journalist, humanitarian, and award-winning filmmaker, Will Watson details the radical peace plan that used music, women and cultural understanding to end the Pacificâ€™s worst civil war. This story explores how ending war, one of humanity's greatest challenges, can be achieved with new ways of thinking. 
 William Watson is an International multi-award winning filmmaker,  Humanitarian Award Winner and International advocate for peace. His latest film, Haka and Guitars, was chosen as Best World Peace Documentary as part of the New Generation in Action's (a United Nations supported NGO) Artisan Festival International World Peace Initiative which was screened during the 75th Cannes Film Festival in France earlier this year. The documentary followed the Bougainville Civil War and subsequent New Zealand lead peacekeeping mission that and is now considered to be modern history's most successful intervention. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
