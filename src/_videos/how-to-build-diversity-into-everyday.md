Annamarie firmly believes that everyone has the right to contribute to society, to follow a passion, and to be connected to our communities in some shape or form.

In her position as the People & Culture Director for&nbsp;[Stuff.co.nz](http://stuff.co.nz/), she launched and implemented the award-winning&nbsp;*Creative Spirit programme*, which gives young adults with intellectual disabilities a chance to contribute to society in a meaningful way.

This was followed by&nbsp;*The Coffee CO-OP*, Stuff’s Auckland office cafe, which is staffed by deaf baristas, and received the&nbsp;*2017 Attitude ACC Employer Award*, and in the same year was a&nbsp;*Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Award*&nbsp;Finalist.

She also won Fairfax Media’s inaugural&nbsp;*Women of Influence Community Leader*&nbsp;award in recognition of this work, which supports the employment of people with disabilities.
