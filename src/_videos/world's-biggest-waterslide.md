Jimi Hunt is founder of the depression charity Live More Awesome, author of A Bit Mental and the only person silly enough to lilo the Waikato River. A sufferer of depression, Jimi aims to inspire people by doing the ridiculous -- like building the world's biggest waterslide -- using these initiatives to help others with depression and raise awareness of New Zealand's massive problem of depression, all while keeping himself sane.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
