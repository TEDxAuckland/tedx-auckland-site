Co-Founder of Eat My Lunch, Lisa King explains how her buy-one-give-one company works, but more importantly, how it is able to make a positive social impact while also sustaining itself financially. Lisa launched Eat My lunch with her business partner Michael Meredith in 2015. Their goal, for every meal purchased from them, a lunch would be donated to a New Zealand child who needs it. At the time of this videos upload, Eat My Lunch has donated 870,000+ lunches to kids in schools. In this talk, Lisa explains how her company uses the buy-one-give-one business model to help kids in need. Lisa King wants to ensure no child goes to school hungry. As a mother of young children, she couldn’t fathom that 28% of Kiwi children go to school without lunch. So with her 15 years experience marketing some of the country’s biggest food brands, Lisa founded Eat My Lunch. She aims to show that clever business solutions can solve big social issues. For every lunch you buy, Eat My Lunch gives a lunch to a Kiwi kid in need. In the first 2 years, EAL has given 450,000 lunches to kids from low-decile schools across the North Island. 

Eat My Lunch has been the recipient of numerous awards including three Westpac Auckland Business Awards in 2016, Deloitte's Fast 50 Rising Star 2016 and 2017, TVNZ Marketing Awards 2016, and Lisa was awarded a Women of Influence Award in both 2016 and 2017. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
