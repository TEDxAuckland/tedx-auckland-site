There are many advantages and disadvantages by being an independent journalist. Keith's talk blows them away and the media industry itself by showcasing the pros and cons of it.

As a young man, Keith dreamed of being a hobo-journalist – seeing the world and telling stories while living out of a sack. But what started out as a naive warzone adventure turned into lifelong vendetta and alternative funding model for independent journalism.

It has been almost a decade, and these days Keith does data visualisation consulting to fund his journalism projects, with the thought of sustainable crowdfunding just over the horizon. The independence from self-funding (“Batman journalism!”) creates a wonderful and dangerous space for innovation, disruption, getting lost and going crazy. If he’s lucky, one day, it might even allow him to live out of a sack.
