The future of the space industry is not going to be a particularly utopian one if it is only accessible to the wealthy elite. Emeline Paat-Dahlstrom discusses how technology has already started to bridge the gap between the privileged and unprivileged regarding access to space, and how she and her team at SpaceBase NZ are helping establish a sustainable industry for the future of space exploration - A future where the journey to space is just as far from you as anyone else, regardless of your circumstances.  Emeline Paat-Dahlstrom is a space entrepreneur. Originally from the Philippines, sheâ€™s spent nearly 30 years building space and technology educational ecosystems around the world, including International Space University programs in eight countries. Emeline has also worked for space startup companies such as Space Adventures, the first space tourism company to send private citizens to the International Space Station.

As a Fellow of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship, Emeline now has her sights set on New Zealand, moving here from Silicon Valley to co-found SpaceBase, a networking a funding platform focused on creating a sustainable space ecosystem in Aotearoa. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
