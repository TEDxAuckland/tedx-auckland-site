Assil Russell is a young dental surgeon from Hamilton who has a passion for helping others. Born in Iraq and raised in New Zealand, at the age of 21 Assil set up New Zealand's first and only registered medical and dental charity for Iraqi orphans and disadvantaged children - ICARE (Iraqi Children's Aid & Repair Endeavour). Assil believes that "You don't have to be a doctor to save lives" and ICARE is now an international movement that is empowering ordinary people from all walks of life to make a real difference, one smile at a time.
