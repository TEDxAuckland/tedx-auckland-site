Assil Russell is a young dental surgeon from Hamilton who has a passion for helping others. Born in Iraq and raised in New Zealand, at the age of 21 Assil set up New Zealand's first and only registered medical and dental charity for Iraqi orphans and disadvantaged children - ICARE (Iraqi Children's Aid & Repair Endeavour). Assil believes that "You don't have to be a doctor to save lives" and ICARE is now an international movement that is empowering ordinary people from all walks of life to make a real difference, one smile at a time.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
