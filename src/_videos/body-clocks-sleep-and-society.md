Humans have different body clocks or circadian rhythms. These rhythms are more nature than nurture and we can only influence them only to a small degree. Most of us feel sleepy at night, sleep before midnight and wake up in the morning. However, for a small population they naturally feel alert at night, fall asleep after midnight, and as a result wake up closer to midday. From teenagers who naturally experience a temporary shift in sleeping patterns to adults who are glued to their blue light devices. Dr Tony Fernando shares his thoughts, anecdotes and scientific insights on this biological phenomenon.
