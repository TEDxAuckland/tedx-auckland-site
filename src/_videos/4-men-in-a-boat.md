TEDxAuckland 2009, Billy Gammon, 4 Men In A Boat.

Charting the course of Billy's life would take some serious navigation skills. But one path stands out -- his involvement in a rowing race across the Indian Ocean. Brought only by traumatic personal news, Billy's journey to the start line and beyond is an intensely human and inspirational story.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
