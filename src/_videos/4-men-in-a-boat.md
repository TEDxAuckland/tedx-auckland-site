TEDxAuckland 2009, Billy Gammon, 4 Men In A Boat.

Charting the course of Billy's life would take some serious navigation skills. But one path stands out â€“ his involvement in a rowing race across the Indian Ocean. Brought only by traumatic personal news, Billy's journey to the start line and beyond is an intensely human and inspirational story.
