Gavin's talks about media and the current continuing environmental degradation our impact has on the planet while explaining his solution for making media a force for good and not continuing on the same path.

Gavin is originally from Ireland and from a very young age has been researching Celtic spirituality, behavioural change psychology and the medias influence on society.

His talk weaves the impact of growing up in country devastated by centuries of civil war, and how the 5,500 year old spiritual sites that surrounded his childhood home gave him hope, while leading him to his current profession and mission in life.
