One one level, the Modern Māori Quartet was formed to bring to the stage the easygoing vibe its founders remember from their parents' casual, guitar-fuelled garage parties of the 70s and 80s. At a deeper level, though, the MMQ's performance and talk challenges the way indigenous peoples are perceived in Western society and uses an ancient culture to build a bridge any audience can cross. 

The suave crooners from the award-winning Modern Māori Quartet invite you to enjoy a fresh take on the classic Māori showbands of yesteryear.

Toi Whakaari: New Zealand Drama School alumni James Tito, Maaka Pohatu, Matariki Whatarau and Francis Kora bring the concept of a Māori Rat Pack into the present with a contemporary twist, weaving their acting and musical talents together to fuse hearty and humorous Māori storytelling with the glorious tradition of showband entertainment.

Modern Māori Quartet blends old school charm with modern pizzazz to highlight Aotearoa New Zealand’s musical past and present, featuring unique spins on Māori waiata (song), showband hits and pop music, all infused with the multi-talented Māori foursome’s irresistible charisma, sublime harmonies and universal humour.
