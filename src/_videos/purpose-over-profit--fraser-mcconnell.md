After the death of his best friend, Fraser McConnell's priorities in life changed dramatically. Instead of jumping straight into the corporate world, he instead dedicated his time to creating startups with a social conscience, focusing on conservation and charity. In this talk, Fraser explores the choice he had to make between a career of purpose or a career of profit, and why we should all be choosing the former. Fraser cares about inspiring the world to choose purpose over profit.

He has a track record in social entrepreneurship and technological innovation with projects such as Squawk Squad which marries technology with conservation in helping save the native birds of New Zealand. Fraser is also the co-founder of the blockchain social enterprise, Choice. Choice is a new contactless payments system utilising QR codes that reduces transaction fees for kiwi merchants and allows consumers to allocate 50% of this fee to a charity of their choice.
