We know waste is a serious problem for the health of the planet, and yet we don’t recognise the impact of wastefulness on human wellbeing. Occupational therapist and founder of Rekindle, Juliet Arnott describes waste as not only a waste of earth’s resources, but also as a waste of ourselves and our capabilities. She offers resourcefulness as the solution.
 Juliet is the Founder and Director of Rekindle. Growing up on a small farm on the banks of the Wakamarina river in Marlborough, Juliet believes humans miss out on opportunities to be resourceful when they are wasteful due to consumerist lifestyles.

She started Rekindle in 2010 to create opportunities for resourcefulness. Since then, Rekindle has completed five major projects including using timber from damaged homes in the Christchurch Earthquake to create furniture, the first ever Whole House Reuse, and a nationwide project that enabled designers to focus on commercial waste. Rekindle’s current initiative is Resourceful Otautahi, offering workshops on resourceful skills using materials such as timber and fallen ti kouka leaves. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
