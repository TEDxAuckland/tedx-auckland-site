In recent years, the South Korean media industry has become a global phenomenon. Anna Faber’s psychoanalytic research of South Korean media, it’s inception, development, and success draws controversial and challenging ideas about the impact of the industry on contemporary society, and its significance in the foundation of a nationwide establishment of normativity.
 Anna Faber is a Master’s student at The University of Auckland researching the interaction between the US and Asia within a film context. In particular, her world-first research explores the impact South Korean film and media has on South Korean society. Notoriously censored in the past, South Korean film has underscored major political movements and provided somewhat of a guideline to South Korean existence.

Anna was awarded a first class honours degree in which she undertook various studies in feminist film theory and documentary-making in addition to a dissertation on the concept of borders in South Korean horror film. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
