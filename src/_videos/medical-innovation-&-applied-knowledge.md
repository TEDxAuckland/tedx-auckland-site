TEDxAuckland 2009, Ray Avery on Medical Innovation & Applied Knowledge.

Scientist, inventor & humanitarian -- just some of the labels that are inadequate
to describe Ray, the founder and CEO of Medicine Mondiale. Ray's efforts have
resulted in 11 million patients worldwide -- especially in the world's poorest countries -- having eye-sight saving surgery. TEDxAuckland, 1st October 2009.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
