This vibrant and innovative approach to social change has caught the attention of government, business, entrepreneurs and communities throughout New Zealand and the world. At itâ€™s heart Be.

Values of creativity, positivity, flexibility and generosity are at the heart of this social movement and underpin the work of Be.
