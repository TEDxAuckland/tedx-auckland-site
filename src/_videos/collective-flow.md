This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Rhythm Interactive is an interactive percussion experience.

Leaving New Zealand in 1996 to go on his big OE, John returned to New Zealand with an exciting idea - to set up an interactive percussion business for the corporate events industry. In 2003 Rhythm Interactive was born, and it has grown to become one of the most innovative, interactive, and entertaining team building shows for the conference and events market in New Zealand.

Since then, John has travelled throughout Australasia and Asia performing for thousands of people of all ages.

In 2009, the show won the category of Best Nationwide Corporate Entertainment at the Corporate Events Guide Peopleâ€™s Choice Awards.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
