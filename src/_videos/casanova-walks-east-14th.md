The second song from Eliot Witters' performance at TEDxAuckland 2018, 'Casanova Walks East 14th' Raised by whiskey, wolves, and Wilco, Witters is a champion of dulcet tones most often found in the American heartland. For TEDxAuckland 2018, Eliot will share a selection of songs from his continually expanding & developing songbook. Once described as Springsteen via Fred Dagg, Witters’ performances draw from experiences such as hopping freight trains in the American Midwest, to being chased out of dive bars in the most northern parts of Scandinavia. All of which are tales that have aged this Gisborne-born crooner well beyond his years. Outside of his solo work, he was the bassist for Auckland barroom rockers "Kingsland” and the guitarist for “Napier Avalon Jones.”
