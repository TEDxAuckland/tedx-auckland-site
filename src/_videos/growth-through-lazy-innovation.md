As a 13 year old, Georgia Lala wanted to change the world – but says she was just too lazy. So she started a journey of lazy innovation: world changing ideas that can happen with minimal effort, sometimes right on your kitchen bench.

Georgia is trying to change the way we look at sustainability. Her award winning research into the applications of aquaponics won her the Prime Minister’s Future Scientist award, and at the age of 18 she started her own business, Root Aquaponics, where she hopes to start selling aquaponic units she designed to homes and schools in New Zealand.

An environmentalist at heart, Georgia has led sustainability expos to educate others on the importance of future proofing today’s industries, and has been invited as a guest speaker at community events. Georgia hopes to challenge the way individuals and companies look at adopting sustainable approaches to both production and living.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx
