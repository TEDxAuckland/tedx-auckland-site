Matt explains how he reduces waste in his restaurants to zero and in turn makes the food, eco system and community better.

Arguably one of the hottest chefs on the Australian dining scene, it’s not rare for foodie fans of Matt’s to book tables 3-months in advance at Sydney’s Stanley St. Merchants where he’s head chef, or queue 100m down the street at Greenhouse, a Perth eatery which was named Restaurant of the Year in 2010.

Matt’s an Aussie that’s serious about food and sustainability - if it can’t be sourced locally, it’s not on the menu. Greenhouse, Australia’s first all-recycled restaurant is a place where foodies can touch natural materials, understand where everyday fresh food comes from and taste food straight from the garden.

When Matt’s not in the kitchen, he’s a regular face on TV and billboards, enthralling audiences on MasterChef Australia, Iron Chef Australia, and on his own TV show, Aussie Recipes that Rock, a series that is aired in over 40 countries.

In 2011, Australian Gourmet Traveller named him Best New Talent.
