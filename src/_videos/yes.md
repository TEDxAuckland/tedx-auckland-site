Jayne believes all of us are faced with plenty of amazing and sometimes scary opportunities; the trick is having the courage to say yes to them. Her first yes led to a series of others, resulting in a girls' orphanage 14,000 kilometres away from her New Zealand home.

Jayne has been described as many things; a brave adventurer, a visionary, an infectious truth-teller, a teacher, a mentor and an encourager.

She has experienced bible smuggling into China, overland trucking in Africa, micro lighting over Victoria Falls, bathing elephants in Nepal, hot air ballooning in Cappadocia, walking part of the Camino de Santiago, trekking in the Himalayas, and horse riding in Turkey, Argentina and the length of New Zealand.

In 2011, Jayne started her new adventure, a charity called Project Moroto which provides safe dormitory living for orphaned girls in Moroto, Uganda. She has provided a haven for 20 gorgeous girls, but what Jayne is most passionate about is giving these girls a “go”- an opportunity to find and fulfil their potential.
