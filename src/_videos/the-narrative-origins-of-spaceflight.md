Dr. Alexander MacDonald, Senior Economic Advisor at NASA, describes the history of spaceflight stories, how they inspired and influenced the development of space launch vehicles, and how the stories we tell as a society shape our collective future. 
 Alex is the senior economic advisor at NASA and the founding program executive for NASA’s Emerging Space Program. With the rising interest in commercial and private space exploration, Alex bridges the knowledge gap and provides the economic expertise.

He has presented at the United Nations on asteroid impact mitigation and his spacecraft projects have seen him design small satellites for coral reef health mapping, earthquake early-detection and asteroid rendezvous. Alex was also a Clarendon Scholar at the University of Oxford, where he completed his doctoral dissertation on, “The Long Space Age: An Economic Perspective on American Space History. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
