Money makes the world go around (maybe!) but many children today have never seen cash... instead watching as their parents pay for things electronically and invisibly. So how can parents make money tangible to their children? James's approach centres on a "cashless moneybox," designed to make money seem real and help children understand the tangibility of money. 

James is the Chief Architect at ASB bank and father of three young children.

As a father, James has a keen interest in financial literacy and the challenge of teaching new generations about money. He believes that as money becomes less tangible in our digital world, we need to find new ways of using technology to impart good money habits to our kids in order to increase their financial well-being.

At ASB James is helping the 168-year-old bank to rethink itself as a tech company, licensed and trusted to provide financial services.
