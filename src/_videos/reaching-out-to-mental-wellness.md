After Matt's wife Mary died of depression a year ago, Matt reflected on what he could take out of it to help others. The result was a programme that encourages people across the farming community to reach out to both ask for and offer help when they need it.

Father of two teens, awarded advertising creative director, ad agency owner, mountain runner, farm owner, poet, Christian. Matt was living a full and rewarding life last year when it profoundly changed last year. His wife of 17 years Mary, a farmer, died of depression.

Searching for something good to come from his grief, Matt used his own experiences to speak out about mental health in the rural community. He wasnâ€™t prepared for the impact it would have or the enormity of the response. The journey since has reframed his own life in positive ways.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx
