Joseph Michael is a freelance film technician, new media artist and photographer. Joseph's latest work is a New Media Arts exhibition entitled "Dark Cloud : White Light" which involves filming 3D time-lapses of New Zealand landscapes and starscapes. This project saw him braving the elements for periods of 24 hours or more to create an experience of audio and visual splendour, revealing the hidden wonders of the New Zealand landscape.
