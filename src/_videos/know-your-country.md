Lillian Grace is the founder and chief of Wiki New Zealand, a collaborative website making data about New Zealand visually accessible for everyone. Through Wiki New Zealand, Lillian aims to make it normal to know your country. In her previous role at The New Zealand Institute, Lillian became aware of some of the challenges we face as a country. She believes that to get the best outcomes we need to make informed decisions in all areas and at all levels, and that the process needs to start with understanding the facts before we connect them to our values.
