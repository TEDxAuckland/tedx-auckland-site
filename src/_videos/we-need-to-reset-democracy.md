Our current democratic system is like a twentieth-century computer trying to run twenty-first century programmes. We need to upgrade our system, drawing on our untapped abilities as citizens. Things like citizens’ assemblies and crowdsourcing laws are the way of the future – mechanisms that allow us, as ordinary individuals, to step up and take a much more direct role in discussing the issues and shaping the big political decisions that affect our lives.

The author of multiple books, including Government for the Public Good: The Surprising Science of Large-Scale Collective Action, he is a regular commentator in domestic and international media.
