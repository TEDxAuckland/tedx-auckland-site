Michael's talk focuses on a cultural and people approach to solving two issues.
1. The pressure on Senior Management to produce results and profit.
2. Conquering the Poverty Cycle for those on the front line who want to get out.

Michael is the founder of Indigenous Growth – a new organisation with a quadruple bottom line – which feeds his passion to empower families like his to get themselves out of the poverty cycle.

Since 2005 he chose a specialised path dedicated to this goal of serving his family and families like his. Indigenous Growth takes a culturally diverse approach, building their people from the grassroots level to provide a more diverse and profitable culture for all organisations.

Mike holds a number of governance and advisory roles for Whanau Organisations, Charities, Learning Institutions and Not for Profit organisations.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx
