Startup brands usually find it easier to create a world-changing product than to convince the world to let them change it.

After spending his life exploring how storytelling builds brands, in this talk James distils the way storytelling can transform your company’s ability to achieve its ambition. More about James at [https://www.previously.co/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=4mAptTGzXlo&amp;redir_token=L4DhL32WPoGChfm0IYIxTSeEaad8MTU2NzEzOTE1MEAxNTY3MDUyNzUw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.previously.co%2F&amp;event=video_description){: target="_blank"}

A passionate believer in the power of creativity and storytelling in business, James Hurman works at a crossroads of brand strategy, storytelling, creativity and entrepreneurialism.

As founder and CEO of Storytech, the world’s first ‘brand strategy in a box’ he has turned this theory into practise, allowing start-ups and small businesses to develop a robust brand strategy for a fraction of the traditional cost.

His Auckland-based venture studio Previously Unavailable specialises in the rapid development of innovative products with non-traditional business models, helping companies big and small bring exciting new ideas into the world.

James’ prior career in the advertising industry was recognised with dozens of marketing effectiveness awards, and in 2013 he was named the world’s \#1 strategy planner. His 2011 book The Case for Creativity proved the link between imaginative marketing and commercial success and has been republished several times in multiple languages. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
