Catherine hopes that through the Garden to Table Trust, children can go up knowing the basic skills of growing and cooking their own food, reducing waste and chemicals in their diets and the environment.

Catherineâ€™s mission in life is to inspire people to cook and eat simple, good food. A passionate foodie and Dish Magazine co-founder, Catherine is behind the Garden to Table Trust, a programme established to teach children aged 7-10 years how to grow, harvest, cook and share food.

The programme ticks all the boxes that Catherine feels are important in the world right now: caring for and about the natural world, knowing where food comes from and how to produce it, and knowing how to feed ourselves and our families.

Catherine hopes that through the Garden to Table Trust, children can go up knowing the basic skills, reduce waste, eliminate plastic and chemicals, and eat only fresh food.
