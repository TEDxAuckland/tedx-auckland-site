This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Catherine hopes that through the Garden to Table Trust, children can go up knowing the basic skills of growing and cooking their own food, reducing waste and chemicals in their diets and the environment.

Catherineâ€™s mission in life is to inspire people to cook and eat simple, good food. A passionate foodie and Dish Magazine co-founder, Catherine is behind the Garden to Table Trust, a programme established to teach children aged 7-10 years how to grow, harvest, cook and share food.

The programme ticks all the boxes that Catherine feels are important in the world right now: caring for and about the natural world, knowing where food comes from and how to produce it, and knowing how to feed ourselves and our families.

Catherine hopes that through the Garden to Table Trust, children can go up knowing the basic skills, reduce waste, eliminate plastic and chemicals, and eat only fresh food.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
