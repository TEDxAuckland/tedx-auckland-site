This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Urzila talks about her life and how she came to be a comedian and her philosophy on giving things ago and having no regrets.

Natural, cheeky and straight-up South African-born, New Zealand-based, Urzila Carlson, took to the stage for the first time in 2008, and has since racked up an impressive array of awards for her stand-up comedy.

Some of the awards she holds to her name include Best Female Comedian at the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 NZ Comedy Guild Awards, as well as the coveted TV3 People’s Choice Award at the 2013 New Zealand International Comedy Festival.

She has also had 4 sold-out solo seasons (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013) at the New Zealand International Comedy Festival, and was invited to Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2013 where she had a hugely successful sell-out season and appeared on the televised Oxfam Comedy Gala and Comedy Up Late.

Urzila is one of New Zealand’s funniest comedians, male or female, and is a true star on the rise.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
