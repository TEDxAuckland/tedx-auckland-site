Urzila talks about her life and how she came to be a comedian and her philosophy on giving things ago and having no regrets.

Natural, cheeky and straight-up South African-born, New Zealand-based, Urzila Carlson, took to the stage for the first time in 2008, and has since racked up an impressive array of awards for her stand-up comedy.

Some of the awards she holds to her name include Best Female Comedian at the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 NZ Comedy Guild Awards, as well as the coveted TV3 People’s Choice Award at the 2013 New Zealand International Comedy Festival.

She has also had 4 sold-out solo seasons (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013) at the New Zealand International Comedy Festival, and was invited to Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2013 where she had a hugely successful sell-out season and appeared on the televised Oxfam Comedy Gala and Comedy Up Late.

Urzila is one of New Zealand’s funniest comedians, male or female, and is a true star on the rise.
