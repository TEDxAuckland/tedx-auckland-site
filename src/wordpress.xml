		<content:encoded><![CDATA[TEDxAuckland Returns with another Stellar Line-Up for 2015

Wednesday, 11 March 2015, 11:04 am
Press Release: TEDxAucklnzd
TEDxAuckland Returns with another Stellar Line-Up for 2015

TEDxAuckland is back for another year of inspiring stories and ideas worth talking about.

The first round of confirmed speakers are: Riley &amp; Steve Hathaway of Young Ocean Explorers, Billie Jordan, founder of dance sensations Hip Op-eration, Dr Siouxsie Willis, a Bioluminescence expert, Shaun Hendy of Te Pūnaha Matatini, Lisa Matissoo-Smith, Professor of Biological Anthropology, Sir Bob Harvey, respected leader in both creative arts and politics, and Janette Searle, founder of ‘Take My Hands’.

The event, which will be held on Saturday, May 2nd at the Victory Convention Centre, is designed to open Aucklanders’ minds to new ideas through storytelling, sustainable-thinking and innovation. It comes off the back of exciting and hugely successful sold-out past TEDxAuckland events.

Organiser Elliott Blade is continuing to build on the momentum, further solidifying the platform that sees New Zealanders’ innovative ideas and stories told on the global TEDx stage.

“TEDxAuckland has become the leading platform and pipeline for the propagation of New Zealand ideas, creativity, innovation and culture to the rest of the world” says Blade.

“Our mission at TEDxAuckland is to make it the Pacific’s leading platform of great ideas, storytelling, creativity and actionable innovation to the rest of the world; to create and foster a sense of community amongst the people and organisations who have gathered (and continue to gather) around this event and to provide a cultural focus and impetus for conversation and debate”.

Previous TEDxAuckland talks featured on YouTube have garnered over 1 million hits, with stories such as Paul Wood’s ‘What’s Your Prison?’ receiving over 120,000 views alone.
Dr. Michelle Dickinson, another 2012 speaker, was recently awarded the Prime Minister's Science Media Communication Prize, and recently started a new initiative with 2014 speaker Vaughan Rowsell, (CEO &amp; Founder of Vend), called OMGTech!, a program that seeks to provide technology training to kids, opening up a world of future tech to Kiwis.

It is these initiatives and community that highlights the TEDxAuckland legacy. While only a few years old, it continues to be a launch pad for world-changing kiwi ideas worth spreading.

With an already stellar line up and further speakers to be announced, TEDxAuckland 2015 will be a not-to-miss event. Tickets go on sale, Wednesday March 11th on EventFinder – click here for details.

		<title>Helen Clark: I advocate for women in leadership</title>
		<link>http://tedxauckland.com/helen-clark-i-advocate-for-women-in-leadership/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Words: Jamie Joseph

The only 2013 TEDxAuckland speaker that sent a smiley face via Facebook as confirmation that she would speak, was ex New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark.

Helen Clark became the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme in April 2009. She was New Zealand’s first elected woman Prime Minister serving three consecutive terms 1999 to 2008, and is also the first woman to lead the UNPD organisation. She has been ranked many times by Forbes magazine as one of the most powerful women in the world.

Helen Clark is confident, yet somewhat unassuming. I didn’t know what to expect when I waited for her car to arrive at the backstage entrance. A taxi pulled up, and our esteemed guest got out, accompanied by her lovely friend Joan. After ordering two cups of tea for their green room I then walked them through to backstage where they watched a young 3D time lapse photographer present his 24 hour “holy grail” trip. The images were dramatic and stunning and Helen Clark, an avid hiker and explorer, was clearly enthralled. But the biggest smile of the day belonged to the photographer Joseph Michaels when he had his photo taken with his new fan after walking off the stage.

Just before Helen Clark walked onto the stage I asked her, “Do you ever get nervous?” And she replied, “What’s the point of that?” With countless speeches behind her, and yet her greatest challenge before her, the lady of the moment knew exactly what she wanted to say.

As she walked onto the stage she was met with a standing ovation. And so it began, “Yes we can. Women in leadership.”

She said that at any one time there are no more than 20 female leaders in the political world. If you are out of sight you are out of mind, advocating that we need women in leadership putting women issues on the agenda. Family planning was cited as an issue. In many cases this is low on the priority list and it is fundamentally disempowering women all over the world. Humanitarian rights such as access to water was another point raised where women appear to push the agenda harder. Using India as an example it was noted that councils lead by women are sixty percent more likely to prioritise clean and safe drinking water, as fundamental to their area, and essential to health and safety.

Born first in her family and growing up on a farm, Helen Clark had no brothers and there were no “boy” jobs and “girl” jobs. There were just jobs.

“I also had parents that believed in me,” she adds, encouraging parents to get behind their girls.

The farm girl that became Prime Minister and is now head of UNPD believes women can do anything. It’s part of her belief system, and she’s living proof to support the rallying cry: Yes, we can.

		<title>Matt Stone. The Master Chef of Sustainability.</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of Matt Stone’s favourite TED Talks is by Sir Ken Robinson, ‘school is killing creativity’, and so it’s not surprising that Australia’s hottest young chef has been working in the industry since he was just 15. Matt will be turning up the heat at TEDxAuckland this weekend, and armed with pioneering experience and a bold sense of adventure, this eco-warrior will challenge industry to go where very few have gone before.

Says Matt, “Being sustainable is something I grew up with as my family has always been environmentally conscious. And then when I became a chef the desire to get the freshest food possible naturally complemented this mindset, because freshest is always the tastiest.”

At just 23 Matt Stone joined forces with Greenhouse restaurant creator Joost Bakker, a builder and environmentalist that has taken rooftop farming to unprecedented heights. The Greenhouse in Perth aims to harness the growing understanding of the human footprint to offer alternative solutions that tread a fine balance between functionality, sustainability and beauty. Australia’s first all-recycled restaurant, it is a place where foodies can touch natural materials, understand where everyday fresh food comes from, and taste food straight from the garden. It’s not uncommon for foodie fans to book their table months in advance, while others join queues that snake around the corner, testament to the popularity of their values, “If it can’t be sourced locally, it’s not on the menu.”

Matt Stone now acts as Executive Chef overseeing all Greenhouse kitchens, and he is currently based at pop up restaurant Stanley St Merchants in Sydney’s IconPark, the world’s first crowd funded restaurant. The entrepreneurial start-up was crowd-sourced from 830 backers to fund the new restaurant concept to a tune of AU$281,370. There is nothing commonplace about Matt’s menus, with return customers coming back for items that include spicy crisped crickets and foraged wood sorrel on a snappy mix of fermented vegetables.

Balancing social impact with profit is the million dollar question, and proving to both industry and customers that little things go a long way will be crucial in moving the dial in food sustainability.

Says Matt, “Tools such as compost machines and Juggler milk systems are all quite new on the market, but prices will go down with demand, and governments could play a leadership role in this by offering incentives. We also serve sparkling water on tap, we don’t take any plastics, and our Brothel restaurant in Melbourne receives food straight from the farms in crates, all of our grains and seeds come in reusable glass jars, and all of the milks comes in 20 litre containers that goes back to the dairy.”

When asked how he feels about the impact of beef consumption on climate change, he said that most of the time he uses kangaroo instead, citing that they’re probably the most sustainable meat you can eat in Australia; wild, extremely healthy and readily available. Matt keeps his creative juices flowing by exploring in his own backyard, and travelling to international events where he connects with many of the best minds in the business.

“Spending time with these chefs at the top of their game, and then applying new techniques and methods to my philosophies is always helpful, but the environment is really the most inspiring; exploring the coast and foraging for beach herbs, seeing what is in season, and being driven by the motivation to use absolutely everything. I just love feeding people, especially when my conscience is clear - because I know the meal was produced in the most ethical way.”

Matt Stone is no stranger to awards, and his many accolades include Gourmet Traveller’s prestigious Best New Talent Award 2011 and West Australia’s Good Food Guide’s Best Young Chef 2011. He also has his own TV show, Aussie Recipes that Rock, a series that is aired in over 40 countries.

“The challenge is taking the things you can get and turning it into something delicious.”

		<title>Mike Allsop, on running out of oxygen</title>
		<link>http://tedxauckland.com/mike-allsop-on-running-out-of-oxygen/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Jamie Joseph

I clicked the transmit button on the control column to tell the Coast Guard pilot, ‘This is it, we’re going in!’ The words never came out. Instead what emerged was a sound I had never heard before - a scream, a spine-chilling scream of death. I remember being shocked when I realised the noise was coming from me as the aircraft I was flying nose-dived into the sea.

This is the first paragraph of Mike Allsop’s memoir; High Altitude: Mountaineer, Airline Pilot, Modern-day Adventurer.

In 1995, while flying a small plane 150 nautical miles off the coast of Hawaii, Mike and his crew were forced to ditch their aircraft in a three metre swell under a black hole sky. Mike was 25 at the time, still early days in his flying career, and instead of staying at the back of the plane (where the chances of survival were much higher) he joined the Captain in the cockpit.

“There was just no way I could have ever lived with myself, sitting at the back while the captain ditched that plane,” says Mike.

They shook hands, wished each other good luck, and prepared for the final descent, quite possibly, the final descent of their life. A Mayday call was answered by the US Coastguard, and two F-15 fighter jets and a C-130 Hercules were sent to intercept.

An F15 flew underneath them, and then flew up in front of their plane, the F15 after burners went on, and their small plane flew straight through the wake. At this point, Mike and the captain nearly lost control.

Then the Hercules turned up and said, “You have to retract your undercarriage, otherwise you have minimal chances of survival.”

“It doesn’t retract,” replied Mike.

And what followed was a chilling moment of silence.

They hit the water, Mike’s seat snapped, and he was crushed into the front of the control panel, breaking some of his ribs. His head was knocked back, his jaw was locked open, and he started swallowing water.

Nose down, tail up, a calm and eerie thought crossed his mind that if he took a breath of water it would all be over…

As he swallowed, the aeroplane bobbed out of the water and there was about two inches of air left in the cockpit. He put his lips to the ceiling, looked over to the captain to see if he was still alive, and their eyes met, wide open.

The Colonel that rescued them that fateful night said that he knew of at least 300 aircraft that had gone down off that coast of Honolulu, with more than 1000 dead, and no survivors.

Wake up calls come in many forms; for some people a near death experience is a sign to hit the brakes, for others, like Mike, it awakened his zest for life, and he found himself reconsidering everything that he had ever deemed impossible.

Mountaineering became Mike’s passion, climbing led to him dodging bullets in Russia, and in Peru he narrowly missed a fatal avalanche. But ultimately his “Everest” really was the real thing.

In 2007, at age 37, Mike scaled the mighty Mount Everest.

“Right at the summit everything turned to custard,” says Mike. “My left leg collapsed, and then my right leg collapsed, I was really disorientated and I fell over into the snow. I had that same calm thought as I did when water was engulfing our plane in Hawaii: so this is what it’s like to disappear…”

Fortunately the Sherpa travelling with Mike quickly worked out he had run out of oxygen, changed the bottle, and in doing so saved Mike’s life.

“Looking back I didn’t feel like I had conquered Everest. Everest allowed me to stand on the summit, and I managed to escape with my toes and my ears.”

Not content with being an exceptional climber, Mike decided to take up running. Before long he was attempting to run the world’s highest marathon on the slopes of Mount Everest. Then an even bigger challenge—seven marathons, in seven continents, in seven days.

This marathon fundraising mission raised $75 000 for KidsCan New Zealand.

Says Mike, “My friend, Buddhist spiritual leader Lama Geshe told me that if every person gave a little more than they took in life, the world would be a much better place. And this is how I try to live my life.”

The list of adventures coupled with community give back goes on and on, and Mike stays balanced by being connected to both his wings and his roots.

“I don’t actually like running, and I wouldn’t consider myself a good runner,” adds Mike with a chuckle. “Running is my vehicle to adventure, but my real passion is flying for Air New Zealand. It’s a bit of an oxy-moron, but it keeps me grounded.”

Mike Allsop is an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things, and that’s how he likes it. He has a wonderful wife and three kids, and he just happens to overcome huge challenges. His expeditions often include his family, and when each of his children turned seven he took them to Nepal for some “dad time” and an adventure of a lifetime.

“When people see me as a regular person they can relate to me, and then they start drawing parallels in their own lives, and often people will comes up to me and tell me that they ran their first fun run, or they’re going to attempt to climb Mount Kilamanjaro. And that’s just gold for me, knowing I inspired someone to take that next step.”


You too can take that next step with Mike Allsop, when he steps up to the TEDxAuckland stage on Saturday 16 August, Aotea Centre. Tickets selling out fast.

		<title>Professor Richard Faull: The accidental brain bank</title>

Just as I was heading over to Auckland University for my interview with brain scientist Richard Faull, a fellow colleague stopped me at the lift. She told me that she had recently attended a Huntington’s conference where the Professor was a guest speaker - the Huntington’s gene is in her family. This means that there is a 50% possibility of her inheriting the neurodegenerative disorder. But she was hopeful that if anyone could make real progress in the battle against Huntington’s it would be Richard Faull and his team at the Brain Bank.

In 2003 Richard’s research group provided the first evidence that the diseased human brain can repair itself by the generation of new brain cells. As a medical student he was told that was impossible.

With a research career spanning over 35 years, Professor Richard Faull is recognised internationally as a leading expert on the workings of the human brain and neurodegenerative diseases. This includes Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s. And so I have to admit I was a little nervous about the interview, because I’m not very scientific, but Richard has such a warm and exuberant way about him that within the first five minutes of our meeting I was goggle-eyed enthralled in a lesson of brain science 101.

“New Zealand is an ideal place to study Huntington’s,” he tells me. “Because of our small population it’s a lot easier to trace the family history and communicate with the families.”

Many years ago family members affected by the disease began to bequeath their brains after death so that they could help to determine if their families were affected by this very tragic inherited brain disease, and therefore whether their children were at risk of inheriting the Huntington’s gene.

“I didn’t know I was building a brain bank,” Richard adds. “It grew over 15 years and we found all different things going on in the brain that were not in the text books. We unconsciously set up a programme of brain donation. The only way we knew how to do this was to keep communicating with the families.”

Richard grew up in Tikorangi, a small community in Taranaki, and he says this is where he developed the skills that would play such an important catalyst in his research.

“My mum and dad owned the General store and my brothers and I would help run it. Growing up, learning to talk to people was actually very important,” he tells me. “Now with the Brain Bank we spend a lot of time talking to the families. For us to really understand a person’s brain we had to know the life history of that person. The families are the real heroes.”

During his research, which never really ends, he describes lots of gradual “eureka moments” and unexpected findings. They learned that the brain cells die in different patterns. And so in some brains they saw spotty patterns of degeneration, and in other brains there was a more diffused area with spotty areas more intact. The spotty area was for people with mood problems. And a diffused background was related to movement problems.

“If you had asked me as a young medical student, what’s your blue sky dream? I never thought we would get this far,” says Richard, beaming.

So what next?

“The brain is dynamic in that we are making new brain cells, not just new individual cells, but even the cells that are functioning are changing with every input. The dream is to replace the diseased cells.”

A world class New Zealander, fortunately for us Richard Faull shows no interest in retiring any time soon.

		<title>Robert Oliver: “Homelessness was bizarre to me!”</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Words: Jamie Joseph

I recall a dinner I had with chef and author Robert Oliver a few days before he took to the stage at TEDxAuckland and presented his blueprint for food tourism culture.

We share prawn starters while I prod Robert for tales of his life in New York in the nineties. It was a staggering adjustment for someone that had spent his childhood in New Zealand up until the age 12, and the years that followed in the sunkissed communities of the South Pacific’s Fiji and Samoa.

“Homelessness was bizarre to me!” He says, reminiscing. “How can you have homeless people in New York City?”

I laugh, “Really?”

“Yes,” he tells me. “When I saw homeless people I didn’t understand they were homeless. I just thought they were hanging out. That’s how I started my first food programme. There were a bunch of guys on my corner where I lived and I figured out after a few weeks that these guys were actually homeless, and then I was like, Oh my god, I can’t believe they’re homeless!”

Back then Robert was 29, and not yet the globetrotter that he is present day. I first met Robert not long after his book “Me’a Kai: The Food and Flavours of the South Pacific” (which means “food” in Tongan) had won the Best Cookbook in the World Award at the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards in Paris, much to the shock of the food world. The book was an effort to connect the Pacific’s agricultural and tourism sectors, showcasing local cultural and full flavour for both food and life. But it was also an elbow to tourism. There it was in technicolor demanding to be seen, raising the question, “Why are the restaurants so stuck on importing food and serving western cuisine when the feast is right here on their doorstep?”

But back in New York in the nineties Robert was still finding his stride working for a gourmet catering company.

“So I started taking leftover meals from the restaurant I was working at, and I’d drop these meals off with the guys on my corner,” Robert tells me as I sit opposite him, grinning with amusement and anticipation. “In a flash the corner grew from 5 people to 30 people, and I soon realised I needed to make this into something real.”

Fortunately he knew a lot of charitable folk he knew he could rely on. They organised a van and began picking up meals from an assortment of places and once a week they’d hit the subways, Central Park and all the hotspots they knew homeless people would be. They knew the locations because it was the homeless regulars leading the way.

By the time Thanksgiving came around it was up to a daunting 5000 meals. All this time Robert was still full time at his day job. They worked with a homeless organisation for Thanksgiving and opportunely they inherited the quickly developing programmes.

“Looking back on it now,” he adds with a faraway smile, “that experience working with homeless people in New York helped me with the project in the Caribbean – learning to manage different groups of people from diverse cultures. When I stumbled across the sustainable food model I realised I could turn this into my “job”.

More recently the island ambassador chef has been working on a South Pacific food and culture TV series, and a follow up book to Me’kai that comes out any day now.

Robert Oliver’s TED talk from TEDxAuckland is bursting with passionate pride. He explains how his experience creating an array of menus across Caribbean restaurants was a portal back home to the South Pacific, this time armed with a head full of ideas to strike a lightning bolt through the status quo.

The talk is a strong reminder that its not just a bite of food we’re tasting, it’s culture.

It all came to a dramatic halt about ten minutes into Robyn Paterson’s talk at TEDxAuckland on Saturday 3 August. I was backstage sitting next to one of our crew that was managing the cameras and screens when it happened. She turned her back to the audience and whispered, “I’m sorry” as she tried to compose herself. Suddenly I felt wave after wave of suppressed emotion engulf me. I put my head down, and tears began to fall.

For Robyn’s story is my story, as it is thousands of others. We are part of the diaspora. We were both born in Zimbabwe, and now we live in New Zealand, and it is from these safe shores that we have to witness people we love hurt and murdered under the dictatorship of President Robert Mugabe.

But the immigrant guilt of having left behind her best friend, a young black girl from the Ndebele tribe, was something Robyn could no longer live with, and in 2011 the girl that became a film director picked up her camera and embarked on a risky ground search across Zimbabwe.

“Almost any immigrant will tell you the importance of a friendship increases dramatically when you leave a country,” says Robyn in her TED talk. “Friends back home become not only your friend, but a representation of who you are, and all the things you left behind.”

Robyn decided to film her risky journey in the hope that through the documentary Finding Mercy she could offer a better understanding to the realities of the situation in Zimbabwe – because what you see in the media is not a true representation of how it really is.

“Out here in the western world we hear a lot about white farmers. That actually suits Mugabe,” Robyn explains in her talk. “He encourages it because it makes it appear that all he is doing is addressing colonial wrongs. There are colonial wrongs to be addressed, but want we don’t hear about are the black farmers whose land has also been taken, or the farm workers whose lives and livelihoods are lost.”

Robyn did manage to compose herself long enough to finish her talk, and it ended with a standing ovation.

		<title>Scaling the unknown with Rebecca Mills, Sustainability Strategist</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Jamie Joseph

Rebecca Mills comes from a big family. When she was a little girl she would sit under the dinner table and observe everyone, always acutely aware of what was going on around her.

When Rebecca was nine years old she remembers Bob Geldof’s Live Aid having a profound effect on her. Live Aid was organised in 1985 to raise funds for relief of the Ethiopian famine. Billed as the “global jukebox”, the event was one of the largest-scale satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time: an estimated global audience of 1.9 billion across 150 nations watched the live broadcast.

Seeing those images of starving people on the telly stirred up emotions she had never felt before, and whilst she wasn’t able to make complete sense of that pang in her stomach, she knew it wasn’t right, and she realised how lucky she was to be living in New Zealand with a roof over her head and food on the table.

At nine years old Rebecca Mills held her first protest.

In trying to make a stand for the African people suffering in Ethiopia, she began sleeping on the hard floor in the washroom, with no blankets. The members of her family household would have to step over her, and she got given some firm warnings that if she carried on sleeping in the wash room she would get sick. She held out for a week.

“I realised my protest hadn’t had a real impact,” adds Rebecca, “but it got me thinking from that point on about relativity, and how I might help other people.”

Rebecca graduated from the University of Waikato in 2000, with a Master of Science, and an A++ for her Masters Thesis - the highest mark awarded in Science and Technology for the preceding 15 years.

Straight out of Uni, Rebecca was managing some of the biggest energy projects in New Zealand. Two years later she was taking on the world.

During her stint in London, 2001 to 2009, Rebecca managed a team that looked at impact assessment of major development sites, and during that time realised that the future of creating more liveable, regenerative cities was more achievable by highly targeted and mutually beneficial collaboration with the private sector.

“The redevelopment of London’s Greenwich Peninsular was the biggest planning application submitted in Europe at its time,” says Rebecca. “In working on that project I realised the power of entrepreneurship.”

She went on to lead the team that designed the standards for the first UK Eco region called the Thames gateway. Her work was also instrumental in establishing direction for energy and sustainability for London’s 2020 Olympics.

Fast forward to 2010, and Rebecca was the founding strategist of Richard Branson and Jochen Zeitz’s B Team. Its mission is to catalyse a better way of doing business for the wellbeing of people and the planet. During those two years she worked on this project they recruited a group of remarkable leaders; including Professor Muhammad Yunus, Arianna Huffington, and Paul Polman, to help accelerate a future where the purpose of business is to be a driving force for social, environmental and economic benefit.

More recently Rebecca was nominated to curate New Zealand’s ‘global shapers’ on behalf of the World Economic Forum, and will be heading to Geneva straight after TEDxAuckland. This is the first time New Zealand will have a presence in this capacity.

Based out of Auckland, Rebecca is currently working on open source, scalable solutions in collaboration with a breakaway pack of innovators.

“I see New Zealand as a petri dish where we can incubate and scale ideas and solutions for the rest of the world. For example, how do we create low carbon flourishing cities, and then use this model to scale rapidly to other cities?”

Rebecca’s talk at TEDxAuckland on the 16th of August is anticipated to be both bold and challenging, and transformative if you choose to accept the baton.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Words: Jamie Joseph The legend musician that is Richard Nunns said in his TED talk on Saturday, “I can spend three hours talking on a marae, and I’m meant to come here and say something meaningful in 18 minutes.” After his talk @MichaelHales on Twitter posted “Learned more about NZ from Richard Nunns than 4 years living here. Wonderful #tedxakl.” So yes, it can be done, and so it was, again and again. I tried to gather all the social media feedback the day after the event, copying and pasting quotes into one single document, and by the time I hit page 20 I decided, enough already! The people have spoken: New Zealanders really do have some incredible ideas worth sharing. Throughout the day original and inspiring moments jumped out into the audience, rattled brains with two hands, and tugged on the heartstrings.  <a href="https://www.goldufo.com/ffxiv-gold">https://www.goldufo.com/ffxiv-gold</a> There was utter silence, standing ovations, laughter, and even some tears.  <a href="http://www.greenman.fr/ugg-femme-france.html">ugg femme france</a> And just as it’s challenging for speakers to deliver a powerful message in under 18 minutes, can you imagine how difficult it would be to cram all the highlights of the day into one short blog? So look out for the TEDxAuckland videos as they make their debut through cyberspace, and we’ll be adding our own little behind the scenes footnotes, because it really is an evolving story and the TEDxAuckland team are very much looking forward to taking you all on this journey with us.  <a href="http://www.littlecreek.fr/timberland-chaussure.html">timberland chaussure</a> The day after TEDxAuckland I got a call from Matthew Simmons, one of our 2012 speakers.  <a href="http://www.leschemises.fr/louboutin-femme.html">louboutin femme</a> He told me that after the event this year him and his wife Julie had a long talk and have now decided to stay in New Zealand. (In the last few months they’ve had offers from around the world to set up shop overseas) He explained to me that there is just so much happening and intersection because of the energy around TEDxAuckland, and because of that they want to be close to those that are part of this movement. Like he said in his TED talk last year, “I want to keep doing cool shit with amazing people.” And this is the whole reason our captain Elliott Blade, the producer of TEDxAuckland, started the event last year. In his closing remarks, with the core crew up on stage, Elliott said, “I got fed up of seeing Kiwis always looking for inspiration overseas instead of right here in our own backyard.” Scanning through the comments and tweets one of the highlights for the TEDxAuckland crew was seeing how so many people that were in the audience were inspired to get out there and try something new. In the words of this year’s TEDxAuckland speaker Welby Ings, “Ideas are not safe. And learning is not safe.” So get amongst it, be brave, and keep in touch.

		<title>Urzila Carlson. The accidental comedian.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Words: Jamie Joseph

Originally from South Africa, Urzila Carlson is the accidental comedian who stepped up to the stage for the first time in 2008, and then went on to win best new comer award. At the time she was employed as a graphic designer, and the only reason she agreed to perform open mic –“ just that once” – was because she was bullied into it by her zealous, supportive work colleagues.

They had decided Urzila Carlson is one funny lady that needed to be heard. And the rest is history.

Urzila has since accepted her calling in life, and has racked up an impressive array of awards for her stand up including ‘Best Female Comedian’ at the 2010, 2011, 2012 & 2013 NZ Comedy Guild Awards, and the coveted TV3 PEOPLE’S CHOICE AWARD at the 2013 and 2014 New Zealand International Comedy Festival.

Urzila Carlson is a spontaneous woman. In 2006, after reading an ad in the paper about immigrating to New Zealand, and knowing nothing about the country except the Whale Rider movie and the All Blacks, she packed up her bags and three months later was enjoying life under the long white cloud.

Count on Urzila to bring a few brave anecdotes to the TEDxAuckland stage, sprinkle that with some side splitting laughter, and you’ve got yourself a winning just do it formula.



Ten Questions with Urzila Carlson

1. What is your favorite word?
Yes.

2. What is your least favorite word?
No.

3. What turns you on?
A clean house, time, good humour, a summer’s breeze, sunset and good wine.

4. What turns you off?
Dirty anything, foot dragging, pen clicking, people addicted to their phones, and rudeness.

5. What sound do you love
Rain on the roof, kids giggling, a stream on a quiet day, the ocean any day.

6. What sound do you hate?
Anything repetitive, pen clicking, and Justin Bieber songs.

7. What was one of the naughtiest things you ever did as a kid? 
I accidentally burned down half of our house.

8. If you could break any rule as an adult, what would that be? 
The speed limit on my way home when I have to pee.

9. Who makes you laugh the loudest?
My fiancé, she’s hilarious in a dry unintended way.

10. If you could go back in time, what advice would you give your 21 year old self?
You don’t need to be as honest as you think you need to be, sometimes it’s ok to lie about your feelings.

19-year-old Georgia Lala has made sustainability the name of her game.

The teen plans to challenge the way individuals and companies look at adopting sustainable approaches to both production and living.

This path led her to research aquaponics resulting in starting her business Root Aquaponics designing her own units, and winning the Prime Minister’s Future Scientist Award. Georgia's design created a growing environment for leafy greens on top of an ordinary fish tank – making it easy for anyone to try aquaponics at home.

Georgia shared her idea with the TEDxAuckland 2016 <em>flipside</em> audience – a “highlight in my life so far” - and is relishing the response she received.

“Students have approached me both online and in person about how to go about pursuing scientific passions. It’s been awesome hearing about other people’s passions in the science area and helping them get started, because that was always the hardest part for me.

“The biggest thing it gave me was a confidence boost. Seeing how receptive everyone was to my ideas and visions was truly amazing. “I honestly can’t express in words just what a transformative process it was for me.”

All of this progress has seen her take up residence at Duke University in North Carolina where she is studying natural science thanks to being awarded the prestigious $400,000 Robertson Scholarship.

So for now, her aquaponics projects are on hold but she has bigger ideas in mind.

“Duke has an amazing Environmental Science School that I would love to get involved with and hopefully contribute my ideas to about sustainability!”

Billy T award-winning comedian, actor and writer Cori Gonzalez-Macuer hit the TEDxAuckland stage at Flipside in May 2016.

As someone who makes a living talking to crowds and making people laugh, talking openly about his father’s depression and suicide tapped into a part of his life not many were aware of.

“I’ve always wanted to talk about it in public but never had the guts to do it. I thought if I agreed to do a TED talk about it, there was no backing down – even though I came close a few times.

“Coming into it, I never realised how big TED talks actually were or how much of a community feel they had amongst the organisers and other speakers. It was really cool to experience it with a large group of people.”

His words obviously had a profound impact on the audience, evident in the personal response he received after his talk.

“I’ve had a lot of people get in touch with me via social media saying that my talk helped them or that they’ve showed it to someone who might need some help dealing with depression or suicide.

“I was also contacted by a few organisations to work with them in order to get the word out there a bit more.”

Cori is keeping busy enjoying his young family and is currently in the middle of a stand up tour around New Zealand. He’s also in the works of developing a couple of TV shows that he says “fingers crossed” will see the light of day.
