There are many good reasons to be optimistic about the future – with emerging innovations in science and technology already having a profoundly positive impact on society. Vodafone’s focus now is really about ensuring all our customers are ready to step forward with us and make the most of what is coming. Technology is changing the way people connect, and that is exciting, but there is also a lot of uncertainty about what technology will change in the future.

Vodafone’s partnership with TEDxAuckland is the embodiment of our shared values in trying to make the world a better place. To embrace new ideas in science, technology, education, design and culture. Vodafone’s DreamLab is one such example where ideas are pushing new frontiers.

Vodafone’s partnership with us signals a commitment to ideas, a harnessing of new thinking that shapes our future.
