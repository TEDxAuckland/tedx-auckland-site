We are proud to announce our partnership with Rehu Tai Festival of Oral Language - an Auckland wide, inter-school speech competition. Established in 2015, Rehu Tai this year added 102 Flash Talks, Raps, and Spoken Word Poetry to the competition, and we were amazed with the kids' presentations.&nbsp;

With the finals being held over the 29th and 30th of October, and our next event, TEDxAuckland: tūmanako on November 16th, it only made sense that the Rehu Tai 2019 ‘champion of champions’ be given the opportunity to present their winning piece on the TEDxAuckland stage.&nbsp;

Congratulations to...&nbsp;

But this isn’t just an amazing coincidence, the relationship between TEDxAuckland and Rehu Tai goes back two years before the first Festival of Oral Language was held.&nbsp;

The original idea to evolution of the traditional speech competition for primary school students came at TEDxAuckland 2013, when co-organiser of Rehu Tai, Jane Bush was inspired by [Grace Taylor’s poetic talk on the power of words](https://youtu.be/LivPMiYik9g){: target="_blank"}.&nbsp;

It's an honour for us to help this initiative come full circle by hosting the Rehu Tai champion on our platform.&nbsp;
