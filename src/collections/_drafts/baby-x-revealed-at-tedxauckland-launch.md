“Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.” - Einstein. The 2013 TEDxAuckland Industry Launch took place on Friday 12 July, hosted by Principal Partner New Zealand Trade & Enterprise at the scenic city harbour headquarters. It was an evening of harmonic buzz as one hundred invited guests sparred in the creative realm of ideas. One of the first guests to arrive was Kerry Spackman, neuroscientist and Winner of the 2010 World Class New Zealand Award for Creative Thinking. “What have you been up to lately?” I ask Kerry, after being introduced to him for the first time. “Oh, well, I wrote a screenplay about Einstein and now Hollywood is making a film about it.” “Oh, well, that’s nice,” I begin, eyes bulging, questions tumbling out of my mouth faster than I can construct the dots. Joining that conversation was Rebecca Mills, Global Strategist for The B Team, and on a mission right now to rally up support for New Zealand to be a “people, planet, profit” blueprint for the rest of the world. Speakers and old friends from last year began to arrive, as did many of the new TEDx faces of 2013, and it soon became a melting pot of ideas exchanged between mouthfuls of delicious food served by Pop Dining. The real mind blowing moment came when we revealed Baby X with a 90 second teaser video, which has since been uploaded to the TEDxAuckland YouTube channel. Dubbed “The future of Artificial Intelligence”…The Baby X showcase at TEDxAuckland will be a unique opportunity for TEDx attendees to interact with the installation, and the first time Baby X has been seen anywhere in the world. The showcase is the result of collaboration between Augusto and Mark Sagar’s laboratory for Animate technologies, with the support of NZTE. With tickets selling fast and less than three weeks to go, if you haven’t yet locked in a date with TEDxAuckland, what exactly are you waiting for?
