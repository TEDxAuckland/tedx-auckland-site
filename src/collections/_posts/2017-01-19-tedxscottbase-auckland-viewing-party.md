In 2017 New Zealand will celebrate the 60th anniversary of Scott Base. To mark the occasion, Antarctica New Zealand is hosting a first-of-its-kind event on ice. International voices in science, art, entrepreneurship and more will come together in the most remote location on Earth, and their ideas will be broadcast to the world. You'll be able to join with other curious minds from around the globe for the occasion.

In typical TEDxAuckland fashion we will be encouraging people to head out afterwards for dinner and drinksÂ somewhere close by to carry on mingling with like-minded souls.
