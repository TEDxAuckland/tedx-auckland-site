"Deep technology are innovations that have the potential to advance technological frontiers", however, in recent years, digital technology and software have disproportionately taken up the public's interests. In her talk, Imche Fourie discusses why investors are prioritising digital over deep tech, and argues that while digital is important, we need to put more interest in deep tech if we want to solve the big issues of our world. Imche is passionate about accelerating New Zealandâ€™s science and technology industries. She works with young deep technology start-ups as GM of the technology incubator, Level Two, and is an advocate for investing in technologies that solve global problems. She also believes in the importance of teaching soft skills and commercial know-how to hard science students and does so as CEO of education-focused charity, Chiasma. Though she is supporter of all facets of deep technology, she has a background and particular interest in biotechnology ventures. She sits on a number of investment committees and is a mentor to several young entrepreneurs.
