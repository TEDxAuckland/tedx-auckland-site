What if paradise is possible?

More than just a way of farming, regenerative agriculture is a practice which intimately connects people and land via food growth through prioritising sustainability and resilience. It’s this practice that drives regenerative farmer Greg Hart in his role as steward of Mangarara Station. Known by their motto, “optimising life”, Mangarara Station is a family farm set on revolutionising the food system to restore paradise. In his talk, Greg shares his vision and details how regenerative agriculture is not only creating our future, but utopia.
