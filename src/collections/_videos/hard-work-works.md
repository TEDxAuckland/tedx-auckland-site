Life often gives us unexpected obstacles to face, and Israel Whitley is someone who knows this well.

In this talk, Israel shares the three cards life dealt him, and how he uses his mantra 'Hard work, works', even when it feels like there's nothing to work towards, to continue loving and learning from life. Hailing from the small city of Gisborne on the East Coast of New Zealand, Israel was brought up in a close-knit family who are at foundations of his motivation. Israelâ€™s humble working-class upbringing encouraged within him a strong work ethic from a young age. This in turn became the key and fundamental attribute contributing to the success of his company, Auckland Labour Hire, which has developed rapidly over its two year lifespan. Israel's mantra is 'Hard work, works', which is implemented throughout all aspects of Auckland Labour Hire; especially when creating a positive and personable experience for his team and all others involved.
