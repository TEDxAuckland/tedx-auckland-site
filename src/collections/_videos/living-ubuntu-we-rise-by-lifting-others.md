Getrude talks about the embodiment of Ubuntu in today’s world. We rise by lifting others. It’s a call out to those who are struggling, to stand on the shoulders of those who’ve risen. To give back, to give a hand up, not a hand out. To walk with, not walk by.

She speaks to a notion, borne out of the Ubuntu principles of empathy, collaboration, compassion and connection. She speaks to actions, not words, to living your truth and bringing your own lived experience to bear on solutions. Her talk is a real and an acute account of how her visceral experience is evidence of home grown solutions working best.

Beyond helicoptering in ideas by well meaning philanthropists, it’s solutions from Africa’s diaspora that will succeed and stand the test of time. It’s people hewn from the granite resolve that she possesses, born of the same experiences, villages and towns that are best placed to forge a path forward to better their lives and to tackle the problems they face.
