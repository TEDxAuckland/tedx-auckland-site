On just a ¼ acre of land, Niva and Yotam are starting a regenerative revolution.

Fed up with unsustainable agricultural practices contributing to the global soil crisis, this pair went from strangers studying environmental studies to husband and wife farmers. Now, from a sloping land previously thought to only be good for sheep to graze, they are producing 10,000 kg of fresh vegetables and supporting a diverse ecosystem with their no-till and no-dig practices. In their talk, Niva and Yotam share their vision for the future of feeding the planet; one where agriculture is democratised, fresh chemical-free vegetables are accessible and future generations are nourished with sustainably-grown food.
