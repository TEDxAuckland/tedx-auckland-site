Rhythm Interactive is an interactive percussion experience.

Leaving New Zealand in 1996 to go on his big OE, John returned to New Zealand with an exciting idea - to set up an interactive percussion business for the corporate events industry. In 2003 Rhythm Interactive was born, and it has grown to become one of the most innovative, interactive, and entertaining team building shows for the conference and events market in New Zealand.

Since then, John has travelled throughout Australasia and Asia performing for thousands of people of all ages.

In 2009, the show won the category of Best Nationwide Corporate Entertainment at the Corporate Events Guide Peopleâ€™s Choice Awards.
