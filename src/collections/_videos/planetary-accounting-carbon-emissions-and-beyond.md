Currencies and budgets, though not the sexiest topics, may just be the key to saving our planet.

Kate Meyer, Founding Director of The Planetary Accounting Network, imagines a future where transparency and accountability guide purchase decisions for the good of our planet. It’s called planetary accounting, and, unlike traditional environmental accounting, it encourages conscious consumption backed by the ability to make informed and educated choices. After all, when it comes to environmental crises such as climate change, there are many urgent calls to action, but little in the way of action plans. Planetary accounting gives individuals, businesses and governments the tools needed to turn science into action and contribute to redirecting the current trajectory of our planet’s health. The applications for planetary accounting are endless, and the effects of its use are forecasted to be, quite literally, world-changing.
