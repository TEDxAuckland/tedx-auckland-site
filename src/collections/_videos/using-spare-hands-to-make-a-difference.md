Janette tells us how her charity Take My Hands started and how they running it on virtually no funds and using spare capacity of people and companies to achieve their goals.

Janette Searle had a life changing conversation that turned into ‘Take My Hands’ a not-for- profit organisation that redistributes prosthetic, orthotic and medical equipment to those in need. Every day, freight carriers and warehouses are often only partly full, so, Janette asked, what if we take advantage of that spare capacity and send vital equipment to those that need it? So far, the organisation has sent 50 boxes of artificial limbs, over 35 boxes of medical equipment and used just a fraction of the spare capacity that exists in the industry. So what might happen if we started a global economy of spare capacity? Janette believes there is power in the collective when its collaboration is focused, and that it is people that make the world go round, not money.
