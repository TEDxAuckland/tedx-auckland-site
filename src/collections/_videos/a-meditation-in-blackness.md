In the wake of George Floyd and countless other black men unable to breathe, “A Meditation in Blackness” is a powerful music and movement based performance that examines the realities, past and present of being a black man. This collaborative piece spans artistic mediums, interweaving spoken word narration with stunning visual accompaniment to muse upon the collective experiences of race, culture and belonging.

Accomplished performers Otis Donovan Herring, Fellis McGuire and Yaw Asumadu, under the directorial eye of Renée Sheridan, come together to bring the words of Dr Bayo Akomalofe to life in this performance. Their journey to mastery has seen the trio dance, play, write, act, compose, teach, choreograph and drum on various soils across the globe.
