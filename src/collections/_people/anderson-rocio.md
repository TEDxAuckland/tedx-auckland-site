Anderson is a patchwork of nationalities, half Spanish and half American, yet with neither accent to prove it. She is a twin, born in Italy, who spent most of her childhood in England. She was classically trained on the piano from six years old and at eleven, her family left what they knew behind, to sail halfway around the world.

Those three years of sailing led the family to New Zealand. Ultimately, her love for words and music brought her to a Bachelor Degree in Music, classical piano performance at Otago University, NZ.
