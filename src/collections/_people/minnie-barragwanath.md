Minnie is CEO and co-founder of Be. Accessible, a social change agency that is shifting how Kiwis value accessibility and the contribution to our world by people with access needs. This vibrant and innovative approach to social change has caught the attention of government, business, entrepreneurs and communities throughout New Zealand and the world. At itâ€™s heart Be. Accessible is moving the emphasis from a notion of disability to Poss-ability, from deficit to strength, from disempowerment to leadership! Values of creativity, positivity, flexibility and generosity are at the heart of this social movement and underpin the work of Be.

Minnie was a recipient of the Sir Peter Blake Leadership award 2013 and was made a Member of the NZ Order of Merit Queens Honour in 2014.
