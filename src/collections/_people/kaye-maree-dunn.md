  After the passing of her mother and the subsequent separation from her father
  and brother, Kaye-Maree Dunn, as a child, found herself away from her whānau
  (extended family), iwi (tribe) and, ultimately, her ahurea tuakiri (cultural
  identity). Decades on, Kaye-Maree is not only dedicated to connecting the dots
  of her own whakapapa (ancestry), but giving others the tools to do so too.


  In 2018, Kaye-Maree started Āhau, a blockchain-based whānau data platform that
  is reconnecting indigenous people and pākehā (people of non-Māori descent)
  with their past and identities. She also serves within the C-suite of
  Indigital Blockchain Limited and Making Everything Achievable Limited. For
  Kaye-Maree, though, her extensive work within Māori-specific community and
  economic development projects goes beyond connecting her with others by also
  bridging the gap between her past, present and future.
