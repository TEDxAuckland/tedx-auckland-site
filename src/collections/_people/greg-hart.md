  Greg grew up on a family farm near Methven, Mid-Canterbury. After gaining a
  Bachelor of Agriculture from Massey University and working in the agriculture
  industry, he and his wife Rachel worked in partnership with Greg’s parents to
  develop Mangarara Station in Hawke’s Bay. After the birth of their first child
  in 2000, Greg and Rachel began thinking about their legacy and the world they
  would be leaving for future generations.


  Greg is now committed to being part of the positive change taking place around
  the world to bring humanity back within the boundaries nature sets for us. He
  is transitioning the traditional sheep and cattle station to a farm of the
  future that creates balance by developing diverse, integrated, regenerative
  farming systems, restoring ecosystems through tree planting, sequestering
  carbon from the atmosphere and building healthy soil using holistic grazing
  techniques. The ethos for the farm is “Optimising Life.”
