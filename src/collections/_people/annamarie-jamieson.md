Annamarie firmly believes that everyone has the right to contribute to society, to follow a passion, and to be connected to our communities in some shape or form.

In her position as the People & Culture Director for&nbsp;[Stuff.co.nz](http://stuff.co.nz/), she launched and implemented the award-winning&nbsp;*Creative Spirit programme*, which gives young adults with intellectual disabilities a chance to contribute to society in a meaningful way.

This was followed by&nbsp;*The Coffee CO-OP*, Stuffâ€™s Auckland office cafe, which is staffed by deaf baristas. These programs and the many benefits that have arisen not only to the employees, employers but to the community have been immeasurable.
