  *Passionate / Kaitiaki / Auntie*


    &nbsp;


  From a childhood of struggle Pania never focused on the negative, but was
  fortunate to stay true to her Maoritanga. At nine years old she wrote in a
  time capsule that she wanted to be a lawyer to make a difference. After
  working hard to achieve that, she has temporarily left her law career to
  fulfill her purpose and responsibility to the environment for future
  generations. Paniaâ€™s path through life has led her to finding her purpose, her
  kaupapa: protecting our whenua, Ihumatao. Doing what she was born to do, with
  her tupuna beside her guiding her to be the kaitiaki of the land. She now
  dedicates her time to huis and the occupation of Ihumatao land. Everything she
  does is for others; her nieces and nephews, her whanau, and future
  generations, so the sacrifices are without regret. As a frontline protector of
  Ihumatao she has had to step out of her comfort zone and face challenges, all
  in the name of saving a unique and sacred land, contributing to a better
  Aotearoa for all.
