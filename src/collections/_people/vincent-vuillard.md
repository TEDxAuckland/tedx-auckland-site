  Vincent is passionate about revolutionising the way we work. He co-founded
  FutureWork Studio, a kiwi tech company on a mission to create a world in which
  technology enables more flexible and fulfilled work lives. This starts with
  bringing people together in innovative, fit-for-purpose ways to collaborate
  and solve complex issues, unlocking innovative solutions and breaking down
  traditional organisational silos.


  Vincent started his career as an officer in the French naval forces where he
  spent a decade leading teams in challenging situations, before completing an
  MBA and taking on transformation roles in corporate environments across Asia
  and Australasia. In these roles he saw first hand the opportunity to improve
  organisational and community outcomes by unlocking individual potential.


  Vincent speaks regularly on future of work, and works with schools and
  community-based organisations on preparing for new ways of working.
