*Founder / Business Owner / Life Enthusiast*

Hailing from the small city of Gisborne on the East Coast of New Zealand, Israel was brought up in a close-knit family who are at foundations of his motivation. Israelâ€™s humble working-class upbringing encouraged within him a strong work ethic from a young age. This in turn became the key and fundamental attribute contributing to the success of his company, Auckland Labour Hire, which has developed rapidly over its two year lifespan. Israel's mantra is 'Hard work, works', which is implemented throughout all aspects of Auckland Labour Hire; especially when creating a positive and personable experience for his team and all others involved.
