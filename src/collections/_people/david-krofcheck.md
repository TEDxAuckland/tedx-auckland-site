  David was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. He earned a BSc in physics
  from Carnegie Mellon University, followed by an MSc and PhD in Physics from
  Ohio State University. While working on university campuses in Michigan and
  California, David held postdoctoral positions at both Lawrence Livermore and
  Lawrence Berkeley National Labs. Davidâ€™s current work is based at the CERN
  laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. He loves to play with ideas and is most
  happy when he can uncover similar strands of thought on disparate subjects,
  particularly in science, philosophy and religion. David believes that New
  Zealand should nurture its intellectual resources as it has done for its
  environmental riches.
