  From self-proclaimed “young and naive” environmental science students to
  farmers and co-founders of Pakaraka Permaculture, Niva and Yotam Kay are
  revolutionising food-growing practices worldwide. From their ¼ acre farm on
  the Coromandel Peninsula, they produce over 10 000kgs of fresh vegetables to
  be sold at local markets, shops and cafes as well as through made to order
  veggie boxes. Pakaraka Permaculture also operates as an education centre to
  advocate for and share sustainable farming practices. In addition, Niva and
  Yotam share their learnings via online courses and their \#1 best-selling book
  “The Abundant Garden.”
