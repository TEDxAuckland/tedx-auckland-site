  *Electronic Duo*


    &nbsp;


  Imugi 이무기 is a poppin’ two-piece band consisting of the colourful and
  sunkissed producer Carl Ruwhiu and smooth singer/songwriter Yery Cho. The duo
  are high school friends and bedroom artists, who released their first single
  in 2014, taking their time to slowly release their next project in 2017.
  Imugi’s debut EP, Vacasian was self-released just under a year ago. Travelling
  across a smooth mix of synth-pop, R&B, funk and spoken word, the EP is a
  conversation with one’s self.


    &nbsp;


  Where do we reside within the diaspora and where are we going? These songs and
  spoken poems are dedicated to all WOC (women of colour) and queer friends who
  grew up caught between blurry non-existent lines of the bicultural experience
  that frame our identities. Imugi is about feeling good, feeling yourself in
  your own head and body and becoming aware of the blessing and wholeness of
  your being and allowing yourself in the places where others don’t.
