  *Singer / Song Writer*


    &nbsp;


  Raised by whiskey, wolves, and Wilco, Witters is a champion of dulcet tones
  most often found in the American heartland. For TEDxAuckland 2018, Eliot will
  share a selection of songs from his continually expanding & developing
  songbook. Once described as Springsteen via Fred Dagg, Witters’ performances
  draw from experiences such as hopping freight trains in the American Midwest,
  to being chased out of dive bars in the most northern parts of Scandinavia.
  All of which are tales that have aged this Gisborne-born crooner well beyond
  his years. Outside of his solo work, he was the bassist for Auckland barroom
  rockers "Kingsland” and the guitarist for “Napier Avalon Jones.”


    &nbsp;


  Perhaps his biggest achievement thus far, Witters once scored a tidy 22\* not
  out to almost win the last game of the season for his team in Auckland’s
  Social Cricket Sunday League Division 4 two years ago.
