  Moving to New Zealand’s capital in the turbulent political era of the early
  80’s as a management consultant, it would be his skill with pencil and paper
  that would initially bring Jim to the publics attention.


  Delivering his satirical take with his published cartoons, Jim drew some of
  the countries most enduring political figures saw him become an award winning
  political cartoonist with his work lodged in the National Libraries Cartoon
  Archive.


  Off the printed page however Jim has been a life time lover of the natural
  world. Actively working in Wellington and National Conservation for the last
  30 years with Community conservation groups, Government Departments and Local
  Authorities he is the author of the successful “Natural Wellington” plan, the
  founder of Zealandia (formerly Karori Sanctuary) and the architect of the
  fenced ecosanctuary. He has been the prime mover of urban and community
  conservation, the most dynamic growth sectors in NZ conservation over the last
  20 years.


  In 2001 he received a Queens Service Medal (QSM) for services to conservation.
