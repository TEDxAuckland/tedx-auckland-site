Quentin Atkinson is a Professor in Psychology at the University of Auckland, where he teaches courses on evolution and human behaviour and co-directs the Behavioural Insights Exchange. His research focuses on how cultural systems such as language, religion and government evolve through time and how the cultural values, norms and institutions they represent shape our behaviour. Quentinâ€™s research regularly features in international media outlets including the NY Times, the BBC, the Economist and New Scientist. In 2019, he co-founded climate action group [Claxon](http://claxon.nz), one of many outlets where he promotes understanding and action around climate change.
