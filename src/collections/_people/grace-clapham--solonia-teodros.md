*humanist* / *entrepreneur* / *cultural weaver*

Solonia and Grace grew up as Third Culture Kids, products of an all-encompassing global culture that never stops evolving; citizens of a world where societal disruptions and sea changes are the norm. Yearning for a space in which transformation was encouraged they built The Change School to enable individuals to connect to themselves and each other â€“ building upon a shared goal of self-realisation and the desire to make a positive impact on the global community.
