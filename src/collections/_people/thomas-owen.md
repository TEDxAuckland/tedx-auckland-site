  Dr Thomas Owen is an author, teacher, filmmaker, and passionate advocate for
  peace, social justice, and the eradication of arbitrary inequality. Thomas’
  research, writing, and films explore ways to address the multiple inequalities
  that characterise our globalised, colonised, and increasingly commercialised
  planet.&nbsp;


  His most recent project focuses on privilege loss, exploring how we experience
  and communicate relative losses of privilege, across a variety of social
  categories relating to age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexual
  identity, and physical and mental health, among others.&nbsp;


  Thomas is also a Senior Lecturer in Communication Studies at AUT - teaching
  Intercultural Communication and Global Crises and the Media, while supervising
  postgraduate research, the author of ‘Patents, Pills and the Press’ - a book
  about global HIV/AIDS medicines access and intellectual property protections,
  and ‘Our Stories’ - a film about decolonising education in the Canadian
  Yukon.&nbsp;


  He is a father, husband, Quaker and musician, living between Auckland and the
  Yukon, Northern Canada.
