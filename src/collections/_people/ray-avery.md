Sir Ray Avery GNZM is a successful scientist, author, inventor, entrepreneur, philanthropist and start up investor.

A former street kid who became an internationally recognised scientist, Sir Ray founded Medicine Mondiale in 2003 because he believed it was possible to improve healthcare outcomes on a global scale.

Today an international network of scientists, technologies and corporations support Medicine Mondiale donating their knowledge and skills to make a difference.

Sir Ray describes the Medicine Mondiale team as "The Crazy Ones", because the people that are crazy enough to believe that they can change the world, are the ones that do.
