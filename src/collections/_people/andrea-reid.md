Andrea Reid started a movement in New Zealand that aims to connect the city's parks, reserves and urban agricultural centres together to form Pollinator Paths. These paths will help bring crucial pollinators into our urban areas to enable our growing urban food network to thrive.

The concept started in 2014 as a University thesis for her final year of a Bachelor of Landscape Architecture degree, and has now grown into a fully fledged movement.

Andrea is currently collaborating with the Waitemata Local Board, Auckland Council, Auckland Transport, Gecko NZ Trust, For the Love of Bees, Kelmarna Gardens, several local community groups, sponsors & a bunch of passionate volunteers to create a series of prototypes to install throughout Auckland.

The project has won multiple awards and has been featured on Whanau Living, RadioNZ, NZ Herald, Stuff & the NZ Gardner Magazine.
