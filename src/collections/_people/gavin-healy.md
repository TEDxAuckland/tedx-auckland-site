Gavin Healy has over 20 years’ experience in the media industry. He is currently the Director of a marketing for social good publishing company called Viridian Media. Viridian co-founded Element magazine with the New Zealand Herald, which is the largest sustainability magazine in NZ. It gained global accolades within the media industry as it was crowned Best New Product at the International News Media Marketing Awards. “The whole idea of Element was to craft engaging media for positive social behavioural change”.

Gavin is originally from Ireland and from a very young age has been researching Celtic spirituality, behavioural change psychology and the medias influence on society.

His talk weaves the impact of growing up in country devastated by centuries of civil war, and how the 5,500 year old spiritual sites that surrounded his childhood home gave him hope, while leading him to his current profession and mission in life.
