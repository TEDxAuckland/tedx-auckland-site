Irina Miller is a business consultant turned deep-tech startup founder. Deeply concerned with the severe impacts the dairy industry has on our environment, she launched Daisy Lab, a precision fermentation company that produces identical dairy proteins without the associated harm to our land, rivers and animals. Though initially lacking in technical knowledge, Irinaâ€™s passion for reimagining the sourcing of valuable dairy ingredients has seen her embark on a personal and professional journey to ultimately change the entire industry.
