  Irina is a business consultant turned deep-tech start-up founder. She was
  deeply concerned with the impact our dairy industry has on our environment and
  our animals and thought there was a better way of creating valuable dairy
  ingredients other than grazing, impregnating and milking millions of cows.
  Having little initial technical knowledge but a lot of passion and drive she
  embarked on the journey of personal and professional change to ultimately
  change the entire industry.
