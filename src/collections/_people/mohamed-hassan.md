  Mohamed Hassan is a spoken word poet and journalist from Cairo, Egypt. He has
  spent the majority of his life in Auckland, navigating the spaces between two
  cultures and languages. A storyteller at heart, his poetry uses characters,
  narratives and humour to explore identity and society. He strongly believes in
  the power of poetry to build foundations for young people to speak and be
  heard. He is the winner of the Rising Voices Youth Poetry Slam 2013, and has
  been performing across Auckland stages for three years. He is part of a young
  collective of poets called the Waxed Poetic Revival.
