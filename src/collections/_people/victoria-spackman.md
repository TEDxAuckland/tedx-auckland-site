  talented producers, creatives and technicians. The Gibson Group’s innovative
  visitor attractions and museum works, and its hugely popular television
  programmes and films have been exported around the world.&nbsp; Recent
  projects include an immersive museum outreach project in Copenhagen which has

  Nations, and a soon-to-be-released comedy horror feature film called Fresh
  Meat.
