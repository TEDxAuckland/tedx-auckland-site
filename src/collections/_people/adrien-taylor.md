*journalist* / *turned entrepreneur*

Adrien is the former environment reporter for 3News (now Newshub). He left his full-time position in Auckland last year to pursue the startup dream. Since then, he’s been to Bangladesh to film a climate change documentary for the United Nations and has gone on to found two companies: furniture procurement website Bamtino and cap company Offcut. Adrien came up with the idea for Offcut on a visit to his father’s textile warehouse in Christchurch. He thought it was ridiculous that so many perfectly good off-cuts were thrown out to landfill, so he got his best mate Matt Purcell involved to launch their range of super limited five panel caps. All Offcut caps are handcrafted in New Zealand and a tree is planted with every cap sold.
