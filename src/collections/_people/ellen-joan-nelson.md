Dr Ellen Joan Nelson is an ex-Army, academic business Mum with a deep conviction that the working world can and must be better. Ellen served in, conducted doctoral research about, and then advised to, the military; helping them to significantly improve their inclusion and diversity policies and practices, especially around gender. Her subsequent research focused on the experiences of working parents in the corporate sector, identifying significant flaws with the current, archaic, construct of work.

Ellen now runs her own consulting business, helping organisations to remove inequitable structures and simultaneously improve social and economic outcomes. Ellen’s passion for addressing unsatisfactory situations extended to her and her team’s volunteer involvement in the recent evacuation of several hundred people from Afghanistan, including the staff who had worked in Ellen’s team when she served there.
