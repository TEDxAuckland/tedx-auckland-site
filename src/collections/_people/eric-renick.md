Originally from Indiana, Eric is currently the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestraâ€™s Principal Percussionist. A regular collaborator with cross-genre musicians as well as film scoring Eric has participated in digital media collaborations and performed in orchestras worldwide.

In 2007 Eric was awarded a Fellowship with the New World Symphony (NWS) where he was celebrated for his multifaceted performance and musicianship, community and audience engagement, and leadership and professional development.

Despite his many successes Eric saw a need to help young percussionists with limited resources he created a digital platform to offer them meaningful and practical support. [thePercussionER.com](http://www.thepercussioner.com) is committed to helping students find a community to share their experiences and improve their playing. This has created a diverse community that has thrived on a common love of percussion with a rhythm that reverberates much further than the concert hall.
