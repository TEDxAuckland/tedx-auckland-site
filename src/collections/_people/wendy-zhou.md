  Though not a farmer, Wendy Zhou is responsible for the harvesting and
  distribution of over 300 000 kg worth of produce. As a Senior Insights
  Specialist and data-savvy entrepreneur, she is passionate about listening to
  the stories that data tells. Following her discovery that 40% of fresh fruit
  and vegetables never leave farms due to their appearance, Wendy founded
  Perfectly Imperfect, a social enterprise set on making perfect out of an
  imperfect food system. Today, Wendy and her team ensures this nutritious food
  is plated via subscription service, food bank donations as well as Aucklandâ€™s
  first pay-it-forward community shop.
