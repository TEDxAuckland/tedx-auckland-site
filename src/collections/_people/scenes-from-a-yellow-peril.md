Scenes from a Yellow Peril is the latest play by award-winning theatre-maker Nathan Joe, hot off the success of I am Rachel Chu. With equal parts anger and humour, this collection of provocations explores the complicated minefield of contemporary identity politics through an East Asian lens. An urgent warcry against everyday racism and systems of abuse.

Nathan Joe will be joined by fellow trailblazers from Proudly Asian Theatre, Chye-Ling Huang and Marianne Infante, to bring excerpts from the play to life.
