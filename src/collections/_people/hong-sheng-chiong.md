Dr. Hong Sheng Chiong is currently an eye doctor in Gisborne hospital. He was trained in Ireland and was awarded the medical degree MB BCh BAO. He also obtained a postgraduate training in ophthalmology (PGDipOphthBS) from University of Otago and is currently a Master's in ophthalmology research candidate. He completed his clinical training in Ireland before he crossed over to New Zealand where he initially worked as a registrar in neurosurgery and general surgery before he stepped into the world of eye. His main interests are eye regenerative medicine, bioengineering and telemedicine. His exposure to third world medicine in Kenya, Nepal and Malaysia have given him the insight to the burden of preventable blindness. He believes the problem lies in the access to quality eye care. In 2014, he founded OphthalmicDocs, an R&D company that focuses on the development of ultra mobile and economical eye tests and diagnostics devices. He has invented several eye imaging adapters that can be used in conjunction with a mobile application to diagnose and monitor eye diseases. Fighting preventable blindness is his career's primary mission.
