As we hit the eve of the summer months TEDxAuckland returns to Whoa! Studios for 2023. Come along for an exceptional confluence of ideas, new connections, forking amazing food and jamboree.

Socialise with speakers, attendees and crew at the inclusive dinner in the same venue at The Grounds owned by renowned Kiwi chef Ben Bayly. The Grounds was created by two West Auckland family men who know their way around a kitchen – Mike Shatura and Ben Bayly. Their seasonal menu has a distinctly local flavour, with most of the produce being sourced from Waitakere suppliers. Experience a journey of traditional Aotearoa flavours bound together with some progressive culinary innovations.

At this ultimate Smörgåsbord of brilliant minds, we will take you on an adventure through the increasingly impressive minds of our speakers and display how they are taking their innovations to the next level.
