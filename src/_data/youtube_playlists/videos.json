    "description": "The 4 day week is the future of work. When Andrew Barnes trialled this groundbreaking flexibility model at the company he founded in New Zealand, he discovered productivity, engagement, job satisfaction, work-life balance and employee wellbeing had never been better - so the business adopted it full-time. Media, business leaders, and consumers around the world wanted to know how he did it, and how they can introduce flexible working arrangements in their own workplaces - and here, Andrew explains where he got the idea, how he introduced the 4 day week in his business, and what others need to know to play their part in changing how we work, for good. In 2019, Andrew Barnes' book and podcast series about the four-day week, and the future of work is set to be released so he can continue to encourage businesses to take up this revolutionary practice.  Andrew has made a career of market-changing innovation and industry digitisation. Most recently, in New Zealand, he triggered a revolution of the entire fiduciary and legal services industries, and the transformation he has led as the founder of Perpetual Guardian has positive implications both locally and globally. This was evidenced by his announcement of the four-day week, which made headlines around the world reaching an audience of over 4 billion people from 35 different countries and leading change in government thinking in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAndrew is a director of Complectus Limited, the company encompassing Perpetual Guardian and several other trustee businesses. He is the director of Coulthard Barnes, chair of the Regional Facilities Auckland board, and chairman of New Zealand payroll provider, PaySauce. PaySauce recently launched a new draw-down service to give employees interest-free access to money they have already earned as soon as they earn it, and is aimed at preventing people having to resort to pay day lenders (which charge up to 700% interest on small loans).\n\nEarlier in his career, Andrew identified the opportunity for the evolution of real estate in Australia and was chairman of realestate.com.au at the time of its IPO on the ASX. Later, he became CEO of Bestinvest, a UK-based investment management and advisory company, leading the sale to private capital in 2007, and was managing director of Australian Wealth Management Limited, a major Australian wealth management and trustee business that he led to IPO in 2005.\n\nAndrew is a sought-after keynote speaker and is regularly asked to address audiences internationally on subjects as diverse as governance, philanthropy and business, leadership, entrepreneurship, team culture and change management topics. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

    "description": "In this day and age, setting goals is considered a necessary life skill in order to be successful, or at least, what society deems successful. Instead, Chris Pemberton encourages you to focus on making the journey of life a colourful one and to create the mental space needed to open your mind to its infinite possibilities, as opposed to staying single-mindedly focus on one track. This way we can make sure all of the goals we are heading towards are in line with what drives us intrinsically. Chris believes the way to achieve this mindset is by exploring one's creativity. He shares his story of coming to this realisation, and the art projects he dived into that helped him discover the depths of his creative expression... and a psychedelic experience involving Ayahuasca. With an international experiment called Creative Mirror, Chris proves creativity exists in everyone, no matter their skill level. Chris is an electrician by trade, but his real passion lies in helping people lead more creative lives. As the founder of Humans of K Road and now Humans for the Future, Chris focuses on bring humans from all walks of life together to share sustainable ideas and pursue their creative endeavours. His exhibition Creative Mirror is currently touring the world, inspiring people to unleash their inner creativity, by connecting them to different artists and opening up the art world.\n\nChris also founded the Crisp Creative Club in Australia, which holds sessions to help others improve their creative mindset. As the author of The Creative Soul, Chris believes “If it's the journey, not the destination, then we may as well make the journey as creative and colourful as possible”.

    "description": "Since his first TEDxAuckland talk, David Downs' life has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. A year ago, the ex-comedian was facing a terminal diagnosis, but through a series of remarkable events is now cancer-free. In this moving talk, David shares the three life lessons that fighting cancer taught him. \n\nDown with Cancer helps raise funds to make the revolutionary CAR T-cell therapy available in New Zealand for those who need it.  David is General Manager at New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE), an ex-comedian, TV and Radio actor, a recent cancer conqueror and documentor of his battle with cancer in the popular column ‘A Mild Touch of the Cancer’ on NZ’s Stuff. David was given less than a year to live but managed to beat cancer in a remarkable series of lucky breaks. After a year of chemotherapy, and staring a terminal diagnosis in the face, David got a literal lifeline, with the chance to get on to a clinical trial in the USA. Now a genetically modified cancer-killing machine, David’s reflecting on the lucky series of events that saw him beat cancer, and on his new approach to life.

    "description": "The future of the space industry is not going to be a particularly utopian one if it is only accessible to the wealthy elite. Emeline Paat-Dahlstrom discusses how technology has already started to bridge the gap between the privileged and unprivileged regarding access to space, and how she and her team at SpaceBase NZ are helping establish a sustainable industry for the future of space exploration - A future where the journey to space is just as far from you as anyone else, regardless of your circumstances.  Emeline Paat-Dahlstrom is a space entrepreneur.

    "description": "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. At just 14 years old, Muskan has published two books and hosts her own radio show, despite being born with several serious medical conditions.\n\nMuskan Devta is a bright, bubbly, and brave fourteen-year-old who has achieved much in her short life. Muskan was born with a medical condition called partial hemiplegia. Her right side is weaker than her left and for 13 years she had to wear a brace to keep her foot straight. Being a special needs child gave her a lot of challenges, but Muskan proved that she could overcome them by focusing on the positives.\r\n\r\nComing to New Zealand at age 4, Muskan is currently a student of Westlake Girls High School. She has been an radio host, column writer and author of two books, including her autobiography written to raise funds for Starship Hospital; the book ‘I Dream’ is now part of her school’s Year 9 curriculum. With the support of her family, school, and hospital, Muskan is very successful today. She is on a journey to make people realise that being a child with a disability does not mean you are different.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

    "description": "Sam Stubbs, CEO of online-only, nonprofit investment fund, Simplicity, charts the rise of the modern corporation, and a new era of shareholder activism and social change. Sam looks at how being a conscious consumer can and has changed the way corporations run themselves for the better, taking power away from some of the most significant businesses that influence our society, and giving it back to the people who should. Sam Stubbs is the founder of non profit KiwiSaver fund Simplicity. Sam’s career spans politics, philosophy, technology and finance. He believes the finance industry should be as much a force for good as a source of profit which he thinks can be achieved by companies embracing long term thinking, sustainability and full diversity.\n\nSam’s primary passion is being the best son, partner and dad and he will most likely be found on the water trying ski, surf and sail.

Jess breaks this wide open with a unique talk/performance about how we can slip between different projections of ourselves. See her new project on Boosted here http://www.boosted.org.nz/projects/the-offensive-nipple-show-road-to-melbourne\n\nJess is a theatre practitioner, vulnerability junkie, writer and artist, who loves to communicate cultural criticism through performance.\r\n\r\nShe investigates the way our bodies behave in social relations, particularly in relation to our ongoing colonial hangover in New Zealand. In 2014 her acclaimed solo theatre show Real Fake White Dirt, (Best Writing NZ Fringe 2015) was published as a book of poetry by Anahera Press.\r\n\r\nShe believes that the only way to acknowledge our difficult history is to lean into the real discomfort of being Pakeha. Her 2016 work The Offensive Nipple Show is a collaborative body project responding to the dangerous ways gender politics are disconnecting us from one another. Through performance, she seeks to find new ways of looking at each others bodies, that are both cheeky and empowering.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "Siouxsie highlights how Lego has changed over the decades since she used to play with it as a kid and how the modern Lego is creating more gender bias in what genders do for careers.\n\nAward-winning scientist Dr. Siouxsie Wiles describes herself as a microbiologist and bioluminescence enthusiast but to others she is “that pink-haired science lady”. With a PhD in microbiology, Siouxsie heads up the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland. After recently becoming a parent, Siouxsie has realised that sexism and gender- stereotyping prevails even in the simplest Lego toys. She believes that playmakers like Lego should lead the way in stamping out this gender-stereotyping in toys, with easy fixes like producing mini-figs with double-sided heads: one male, one female, letting children decide who they want them to be, regardless of their roles. For Siouxsie it will, at the very least send out the message that everything is possible and that means everything would be awesome.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "There are many advantages and disadvantages by being an independent journalist. Keith's talk blows them away and the media industry itself by showcasing the pros and cons of it.\n\nAs a young man, Keith dreamed of being a hobo-journalist – seeing the world and telling stories while living out of a sack. But what started out as a naive warzone adventure turned into lifelong vendetta and alternative funding model for independent journalism.\r\n\r\nIt has been almost a decade, and these days Keith does data visualisation consulting to fund his journalism projects, with the thought of sustainable crowdfunding just over the horizon. The independence from self-funding (“Batman journalism!”) creates a wonderful and dangerous space for innovation, disruption, getting lost and going crazy.

He grew up in Brussels, attending the European School, a multilingual institution whose Babel-like environment sparked a lifelong interest in language. Ali studied psychology and philosophy at Oxford University, and then did postgraduate and postdoctoral work in artificial intelligence at the University of Edinburgh. He took up a lectureship at Otago in 1999, where he is now an associate professor. Ali's research is in computational modelling of human language, with a focus on models of language generation. He worked on some of the earliest text generation systems deployed on the World Wide Web, and on an influential web-based human-computer dialogue system. His current interest is in psychological models of text generation: What are the neural mechanisms which allow people to talk about what they see and do?\n\nAlistair's book Sensorimotor Cognition and Natural Language Syntax is published by MIT Press this month.\n\n\nhttp://www.tedxauckland.com/\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

    "description": "Our bodies contain two terabytes of data. What if everyone involved in our healthcare – including us – could access that data and use it to make better lifestyle and treatment decisions? Precision medicine aims to answer that question and turn information into better health outcomes for everyone.\n\nIan began his professional career employed as a scientist writing mathematical models of the human body, before moving into the commercial world. In 1993 he founded Orion Health with a team of just four people and has grown the company to over 1,250 staff in 27 offices worldwide, enabling healthcare to more than 90 million patients worldwide.\r\n\r\nIan is passionate about the role that technology can play in enabling highly personalised care for individuals through the practice of precision medicine – using personal healthcare information that is captured and made available in real time. This technology will transform the practice of medicine into a mathematical science, and for a lapsed mathematician like Ian that means the health sector just got a whole lot more interesting.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Discovered by Frankie Stevens and her famous uncle, Sir Howard Morrison, in her early teens, Lizzie was on the road at age 16 – since then her musical life has been a wild ride.\r\n\r\nIn May 2015, Lizzie launched Villainesse.com, an online media project aiming to create smart, ‘no-filter’ media for young women. Villainesse is on a mission to empower young women and to hear more young female voices represented in the media.\r\n\r\nLater that year, Lizzie launched Villainesse’s first major campaign, the globally-successful #MyBodyMyTerms. The #MyBodyMyTerms videos have been viewed over 450,000 times and aimed to spark conversation about victim-blaming, revenge porn, consent and sexual violence.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

His 40 year history of controversial and theatrical displays of political expression have included pitching a tent on parliament grounds and calling it the Maori embassy, shooting a national flag in front of government officials and the curious spate of public meetings where he appeared with a ladder so as to speak eye to eye with officials who were seated on stage. Iti explores how the old saying of \"Te ka nohi ki te ka nohi\" (Dealing with it eye to eye) creates a far more productive space for open dialogue around any issue. \"No one can tell you that you are not important and your experience does not matter and if they do... I challenge them to say it to your face... where they can see your eyes and feel your breath.\"\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "Watch the Hip Op-eration Crew performance 'D Floor Damager' here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsJjOxGhAE0 Billie formed the Hip Op-eration Crew as a flash mob initially in response to society's outcasting of elderly people. What grew from there was an amazing dance group and community that is centred around the idea of having big goals and  adventure later on in life. The Hip Op-eration Crew are officially the worlds oldest dance troupe listed by the Guinness World Records. http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/111063-oldest-dance-troupe\n\nAfter narrowly surviving New Zealand’s deadliest earthquake in Christchurch in 2011, Billie Jordan felt there was more to life than working as a communications consultant for large corporations. So she quit her job and moved to a small island off the East Coast of Auckland in New Zealand. Once there she taught herself how to dance following hip hop clips on YouTube, then gathered up her elderly neighbours (aged 68 to 96 years old) and established them as a hip hop dance crew with the audacious goal of performing at the World Hip hop Championships in Las Vegas within eight months. From that point on her life and the lives of her dance group changed forever.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Riley combines scientific research with media savvy to take his ideas to a mass audience. His talk describes how he balances the two sometimes opposing worlds of media and science.\n\nRiley Elliott is a PhD candidate at the University of Auckland. With an Honours degree in Zoology and Masters with distinction in Marine Science from Otago University, Riley ventured to South Africa to find his true passion - sharks. Being a surfer, free diver and spear-fisherman, Riley wanted to understand why sharks instilled so much fear in people and whether it was warranted. What he found was far worse – sharks are in rapid decline, receiving little sympathy due to their demonised stereotype.\r\n\r\nThrough the combination of high-tech science and stimulating visual imagery, Riley explains how conventional scientific communication can move at the speed of modern day media to achieve conservational goals. Riley is now utilising this form of communication to address international issues as the presenter of Shark Man TV.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

In this talk, Katie Williams details the birth of The Coffin Club, a company that custom builds coffins on commission for those who are soon to be laid to rest. Katie tells stories of past clients, and how their involvement with The Coffin Club helped them prepare for death.  Katie is the founder of the Kiwi Coffin Club (makers of fine and affordable underground furniture) A retired Nurse who in her career went from Midwifery, through the hoops to Palliative Care.\n\nShe is pleased that a Coffin Club can provide , not only efficiency in construction of a coffin at an awesome price, but members (volunteers) that can give that special empathy (leavened with humour) to those confronted with their own mortality, be it diagnosed, pending or recent and to provide the means to use their own talents to enhance and celebrate their span on this planet of ours.\n\nShe believes in the ongoing wellbeing and respect for the older generation in all aspects of their lives. Many are the volunteers that keep our communities viable. “Volunteers, The Heart of our Community – By many, the work will be completed, Mā tini, mā mano, ka rapa te whai.” This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Matt was living a full and rewarding life last year when it profoundly changed last year. His wife of 17 years Mary, a farmer, died of depression.\r\n\r\nSearching for something good to come from his grief, Matt used his own experiences to speak out about mental health in the rural community.

    "description": "Paralympian gold medalist, Liam Malone believes that technological advancement and determination is the key to his success in sport and life in general. After having both legs amputated in early childhood, Liam felt like an outcast among his peers. However, with the betterment of artificial limb technology, and the advent of Running Blades, Liam found himself excelling in sporting achievement, representing New Zealand at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, and breaking records originally set by disgraced sprinter Oscar Pistorius. But what is the future of this technology? How can it be used to improve the lives of differently-abled people? And how can it be harnessed for future sporting milestones?\n\nHowever, in this motivational speech, Liam does not simply credit technology for his success. He also discusses the importance of determination and ambition to achieve one's goals. No matter who you are, this speech has the potential to motivate and inspire you to strive for success regardless of your circumstances in life.   Liam is New Zealand’s blade runner. Hailing from Nelson, Liam had only been training for two years when he burst onto the track at the Rio Paralympics in 2016, winning a silver and two gold medals while smashing records in the process.\n\nLiam was Disabled Sportsperson of the Year at the Halberg Awards this year and became a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2017. After completing a Bachelor in Marketing and International Business while training, Liam is now a sought-after keynoter and invests in startups. Now, he’s on a mission to develop hi-tech prosthetics with the aim of becoming the fastest man on earth.

    "description": "Janette tells us how her charity Take My Hands started and how they running it on virtually no funds and using spare capacity of people and companies to achieve their goals.\n\nJanette Searle had a life changing conversation that turned into ‘Take My Hands’ a not-for- profit organisation that redistributes prosthetic, orthotic and medical equipment to those in need. Every day, freight carriers and warehouses are often only partly full, so, Janette asked, what if we take advantage of that spare capacity and send vital equipment to those that need it? So far, the organisation has sent 50 boxes of artificial limbs, over 35 boxes of medical equipment and used just a fraction of the spare capacity that exists in the industry. So what might happen if we started a global economy of spare capacity? Janette believes there is power in the collective when its collaboration is focused, and that it is people that make the world go round, not money.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Her first yes led to a series of others, resulting in a girls' orphanage 14,000 kilometres away from her New Zealand home.\n\nJayne has been described as many things; a brave adventurer, a visionary, an infectious truth-teller, a teacher, a mentor and an encourager.\r\n\r\nShe has experienced bible smuggling into China, overland trucking in Africa, micro lighting over Victoria Falls, bathing elephants in Nepal, hot air ballooning in Cappadocia, walking part of the Camino de Santiago, trekking in the Himalayas, and horse riding in Turkey, Argentina and the length of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Jayne started her new adventure, a charity called Project Moroto which provides safe dormitory living for orphaned girls in Moroto, Uganda. She has provided a haven for 20 gorgeous girls, but what Jayne is most passionate about is giving these girls a “go”- an opportunity to find and fulfil their potential.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Journalist, humanitarian, and award-winning filmmaker, Will Watson details the radical peace plan that used music, women and cultural understanding to end the Pacific’s worst civil war. This story explores how ending war, one of humanity's greatest challenges, can be achieved with new ways of thinking. \n William Watson is an International multi-award winning filmmaker,  Humanitarian Award Winner and International advocate for peace. His latest film, Haka and Guitars, was chosen as Best World Peace Documentary as part of the New Generation in Action's (a United Nations supported NGO) Artisan Festival International World Peace Initiative which was screened during the 75th Cannes Film Festival in France earlier this year.

Building a global tech company from one of the most remote countries in the world is just one of the impossible things Vaughan Rowsell has achieved so far. In this talk he tells the story of three impossible people, and how one inspires him every day.\n\nVaughan is the CEO and Founder of Vend, maker of awesome cloud based retail software and champions for small to medium retailers worldwide. The Vend team hold 3 core values dearly to their hearts, to delight retailers, to do the impossible, and to take care of one another. Every year Vaughan personally walks the talk and does an impossible challenge whether it is cycling the length of New Zealand solo, building a $100M venture, or running 1,000 kilometers.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

    "description": "We know waste is a serious problem for the health of the planet, and yet we don’t recognise the impact of wastefulness on human wellbeing. Occupational therapist and founder of Rekindle, Juliet Arnott describes waste as not only a waste of earth’s resources, but also as a waste of ourselves and our capabilities. She offers resourcefulness as the solution.\n Juliet is the Founder and Director of Rekindle. Growing up on a small farm on the banks of the Wakamarina river in Marlborough, Juliet believes humans miss out on opportunities to be resourceful when they are wasteful due to consumerist lifestyles.\n\nShe started Rekindle in 2010 to create opportunities for resourcefulness. Since then, Rekindle has completed five major projects including using timber from damaged homes in the Christchurch Earthquake to create furniture, the first ever Whole House Reuse, and a nationwide project that enabled designers to focus on commercial waste. Rekindle’s current initiative is Resourceful Otautahi, offering workshops on resourceful skills using materials such as timber and fallen ti kouka leaves.

    "description": "Nearly everybody can communicate, and most do so through some form of language, and yet the question of where language came from is one of the most difficult questions in science. Psychologist and author, Michael Corballis explores the many theories of language's origins, including his own, and details how language and communication have continued to evolve, from primates' use of gestures, to the advent of communicative technologies. Michael Corballis, emeritus professor at the Department of Psychology at The University of Auckland is one of the foremost global experts on the evolution of human language. \n\nThe son of a sheep farmer from Marton, Michael’s long and decorated academic career has seen his studies of the brain and what it is to be human earn him New Zealand’s top science prize, The Rutherford Medal.\n\nHe has worked with patients who have had two-sides of their brains disconnected to relieve epilepsy which led him to look deeper into studying the two brain hemispheres. His most recent book The Truth About Language explores the idea that language evolved from manual gestures.

    "description": "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Mike crash landed a commercial place in the pacific ocean, after that he re thought about his life and became an adventurer. Climbing Mt Everest, running 7 marathons in 7 continents in 7 days, Mike gives is story and his idea on how he achieves these goals and lives his life.\n\nAir New Zealand pilot, Everest mountaineer, adventurer and extreme marathon competitor, Mike is an ordinary family man proving that anybody can accomplish extraordinary things.\r\n\r\nLife took a dramatic turn when a flight from the USA to New Zealand led to a crash-landing into the sea off the coast of Hawaii in the dark of night. The US Coast Guard colonel who eventually rescued Mike and his crew commented that nobody else had ever survived a crash landing into that part of the ocean.\r\n\r\nAs well as becoming an Air New Zealand captain, Mike harboured another ambition – to stand at the top of Everest and, true to form, he conquered this goal in an unguided expedition. He has since gone on to conquer numerous other mountains, narrowly dodged a fatal avalanche in Peru, risked being shot in Russia, and returned a replica of a stolen Yeti hand to a monastery in Nepal. He’s also one of a handful of athletes who have ever run 7 marathons in 7 days on 7 continents.\r\n\r\nMost recently, Mike returned to the Himalayas to run the world’s highest marathon around Everest. This was a feat never before attempted and a milestone that was captured in the documentary film Chasing Altitude showing that others too can achieve their dreams and ambitions by overcoming the fear of failure and breaking each goal into a series of smaller steps.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

    "description": "The second song from Eliot Witters' performance at TEDxAuckland 2018, 'Casanova Walks East 14th'\n Raised by whiskey, wolves, and Wilco, Witters is a champion of dulcet tones most often found in the American heartland. For TEDxAuckland 2018, Eliot will share a selection of songs from his continually expanding & developing songbook. Once described as Springsteen via Fred Dagg, Witters’ performances draw from experiences such as hopping freight trains in the American Midwest, to being chased out of dive bars in the most northern parts of Scandinavia. All of which are tales that have aged this Gisborne-born crooner well beyond his years. Outside of his solo work, he was the bassist for Auckland barroom rockers \"Kingsland” and the guitarist for “Napier Avalon Jones.”\n\n \n\nPerhaps his biggest achievement thus far, Witters once scored a tidy 22* not out to almost win the last game of the season for his team in Auckland’s Social Cricket Sunday League Division 4 two years ago.

    "description": "In his study into Strawberry Birthmarks, Dr Swee Tan and his team have discovered a new way of looking at the origin and development of cancer cells. These studies have led to a potentially effective, affordable, and accessible treatment for many other types of cancers. In this talk, Dr Tan discusses how this revolutionary treatment was discovered, and how it could change the future of cancer treatment for the world. #cancerreasearch\n\n From a family of 13 children brought up in a village in Malaysia, Dr Tan completed medical training at Melbourne University in 1985 and subsequently in New Zealand where he qualified as a plastic surgeon. Following fellowships at Oxford and Harvard he became Hutt Hospital’s Director of Plastic Surgery in 2000-2006 and Director of Surgery in 2007-2013.\n\nHe founded the Centre for the Study & Treatment of Vascular Birthmarks in 1996. Unsatisfied with the treatment for strawberry birthmarks he retrained as a scientist, receiving a PhD from Otago University in 2001. In 2013 he founded the Gillies McIndoe Research Institute, dedicated to relieving human suffering through paradigm-changing scientific research.\n\nDiscoveries by Dr Tan’s team of the stem cell origin of strawberry birthmarks underscore the new low-cost treatment of this tumour using anti-hypertensive medications. Building on this work, cancer stem cells, the proposed ‘root’ of cancer, have been discovered in 14 types of cancer, leading to a novel cancer treatment using low-cost commonly available medications. A clinical study is now underway for patients with glioblastoma, a deadly brain cancer.\n\nDr Tan has received many honours and awards, is a holder of six patents and an author of over 150 publications.

Both parents and their colourful circle of family and friends often had poems on their lips - usually told from memory. The Catholic Mass made its mark on Sam too.\n\nThough he likes to call his poems \"songs for the tone-deaf\", Sam has happily worked with musicians - country band The Warratahs, modern classical man Gareth Farr, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and alternative rocker David Kilgour, among others. Sam was special guest at two acclaimed Leonard Cohen concerts in 2009. In 1986, Sam was awarded a QSM - a \"quiet sober man\" he claimed. In 2010, he was further festooned with honour when he was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (CNZM) for services to poetry.\n\nSam has enjoyed a burst of activity in recent years, publishing a new collection of poems Doubtless and the semi-autobiographical Backroads: Charting a Poet's Life, as well as a selection of James K. Baxter poems. His most recent book is Knucklebnes: Poems 1962 - 2012.\n\nhttp://www.samhunt.co.nz/\n\nhttp://www.tedxauckland.com/\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

    "description": "Pania Newton’s path through life has led her to find her purpose, her kaupapa: protecting Ihumātao. Home to the earliest inhabitants of New Zealand, Ihumātao is a landscape of cultural, historical, and environmental significance. Despite this, the Crown has failed to recognise its heritage values for New Zealand, allowing it to be sold for a proposed housing development. Realising that the plan meant 480 high-cost houses on the confiscated land, Pania and her cousins created the SOUL Campaign to resist the development. Later with family members and other supporters, she has occupied the land to protect it. Looking deeply into why Ihumātao has not been recognised as heritage worthy of protection in New Zealand, SOUL has uncovered the extent of the bias toward protecting colonial built heritage over sites of indigenous significance - an issue that is seen across the world. Here Pania tells the story of the fight to #ProtectIhumatao. From a childhood of struggle Pania never focused on the negative, but was fortunate to stay true to her Maoritanga. At nine years old she wrote in a time capsule that she wanted to be a lawyer to make a difference. After working hard to achieve that, she has temporarily left her law career to fulfill her purpose and responsibility to the environment for future generations. \n\nShe now dedicates her time to huis and the occupation of Ihumatao land. Everything she does is for others; her nieces and nephews, her whanau, and future generations, so the sacrifices are without regret. As a frontline protector of Ihumatao she has had to step out of her comfort zone and face challenges, all in the name of saving a unique and sacred land, contributing to a better Aotearoa for all. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

    "description": "Life often gives us unexpected obstacles to face, and Israel Whitley is someone who knows this well.\n\nIn this talk, Israel shares the three cards life dealt him, and how he uses his mantra 'Hard work, works', even when it feels like there's nothing to work towards, to continue loving and learning from life. Hailing from the small city of Gisborne on the East Coast of New Zealand, Israel was brought up in a close-knit family who are at foundations of his motivation. Israel’s humble working-class upbringing encouraged within him a strong work ethic from a young age. This in turn became the key and fundamental attribute contributing to the success of his company, Auckland Labour Hire, which has developed rapidly over its two year lifespan. Israel's mantra is 'Hard work, works', which is implemented throughout all aspects of Auckland Labour Hire; especially when creating a positive and personable experience for his team and all others involved.

Riley was a far better communicator to other children than an adult presenter.\n\nRiley Hathaway is a passionate 14-year-old ocean ambassador, who is already presenting her own TV series called ‘Young Ocean Explorers’. In Young Ocean Explorers, Steve and his daughter Riley present a captivating series of stories about what happens when a teenager comes face to face with the marine animals we’re all curious about, such as stingrays, orca, and turtles. It’s a winning combination: Riley’s got the questions and the teenage-cred, and Steve’s got the boat and underwater know-how. Together, they take us on a journey that has never been previously imagined: a fun, accessible glimpse into the world of New Zealand’s incredible underwater species.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

She learnt the vital difference between surviving and fighting and now shares the practical ways she fought through 9 years of suicidal tendencies. Jazz has since co-founded mental health charity Voices of Hope with the purpose of providing hope and provoking change. Voices of hope has since gained international recognition for its video content and campaigns. \n\nStruggling and need to talk? \n\nNew Zealand: Call or Text 1737 at anytime to talk with a trained counsellor\n\nAustralia: Lifeline: 13 11 14\n\nAmerica: Suicide prevention helpline: 1-800-273-8255\n\nUK: 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433)\n    1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)\n\nChina: 0800-810-1117\n Having overcome childhood abuse and multiple suicide attempts, Jazz Thornton has now dedicated her life to speaking hope and creating change in the area of mental health through her organisation Voices of Hope. Her unique experience and practical message has gained worldwide recognition, being shared through media, international speaking engagements and now through a new feature documentary film. Living by the saying “it’s not about battling your past but fighting for your future” Jazz believes that no matter what your going through it is possible to get through when you learn how to stop surviving and start fighting. In 2017 Jazz was named New Zealand’s youngest director to win the annual Doc Edge pitching contest and is now directing her series The Silence Project which aims to shed light to the stories behind our suicide statistics while changing the way we have conversations about it.

    "description": "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. New Zealand prides itself on its ingenuity and an ability to solve problems with very limited resources. In their talk, Jon Bridges and David Downs suggest that this \"number 8 wire\" mentality is overdue for a rethink.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.no8rewired.kiwi/\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com/\n\nDavid Downs and Jon Bridges are serial co-authors, stretching right back to a time before email. After leaving university, they began their careers together in comedy, starring in comedy programme Away Laughing. After co-founding Auckland’s Classic Comedy Club their careers diverged. David went all corporate - working for Microsoft both here and in Asia before entering the public service, while Jon has been a presenter, writer, director and producer of TV and is also a sought-after MC and public speaker.\r\n\r\nWhile researching No.8 Re-wired, a compendium and celebration of New Zealand inventions which will be published by Penguin in September 2014, David and Jon became convinced that New Zealand’s pathway to achieving productivity matching that of our international peers lies through a rewiring of our famous No.8 Wire innovation mind-set.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

    "description": "The first song from Eliot Witters' performance at TEDxAuckland 2018, 'Late Night Rodeo'\n Raised by whiskey, wolves, and Wilco, Witters is a champion of dulcet tones most often found in the American heartland. For TEDxAuckland 2018, Eliot will share a selection of songs from his continually expanding & developing songbook. Once described as Springsteen via Fred Dagg, Witters’ performances draw from experiences such as hopping freight trains in the American Midwest, to being chased out of dive bars in the most northern parts of Scandinavia. All of which are tales that have aged this Gisborne-born crooner well beyond his years. Outside of his solo work, he was the bassist for Auckland barroom rockers \"Kingsland” and the guitarist for “Napier Avalon Jones.”\n\n \n\nPerhaps his biggest achievement thus far, Witters once scored a tidy 22* not out to almost win the last game of the season for his team in Auckland’s Social Cricket Sunday League Division 4 two years ago.

    "description": "Co-Founder of Eat My Lunch, Lisa King explains how her buy-one-give-one company works, but more importantly, how it is able to make a positive social impact while also sustaining itself financially. Lisa launched Eat My lunch with her business partner Michael Meredith in 2015. Their goal, for every meal purchased from them, a lunch would be donated to a New Zealand child who needs it. At the time of this videos upload, Eat My Lunch has donated 870,000+ lunches to kids in schools. In this talk, Lisa explains how her company uses the buy-one-give-one business model to help kids in need. Lisa King wants to ensure no child goes to school hungry. As a mother of young children, she couldn’t fathom that 28% of Kiwi children go to school without lunch. So with her 15 years experience marketing some of the country’s biggest food brands, Lisa founded Eat My Lunch. She aims to show that clever business solutions can solve big social issues. For every lunch you buy, Eat My Lunch gives a lunch to a Kiwi kid in need. In the first 2 years, EAL has given 450,000 lunches to kids from low-decile schools across the North Island. \n\nEat My Lunch has been the recipient of numerous awards including three Westpac Auckland Business Awards in 2016, Deloitte's Fast 50 Rising Star 2016 and 2017, TVNZ Marketing Awards 2016, and Lisa was awarded a Women of Influence Award in both 2016 and 2017.

    "description": "Grant argues that in the modern world there should be more public citizens involved in shaping public health.\n\nGrant Schofield is Professor of Public Health at AUT, and director of the University’s Human Potential Centre. Grant’s career has focused on preventing the diseases of modern times, and seeing what it takes to help people live a long, healthy and happy life. He lives and breathes the motto “be the best you can be”, and sees this as a game-changer for the health system – capable of transforming the current deficit (sickness) model, to one in which we aspire to be well. Grant is well known for thinking outside the box and challenging convention wisdom in nutrition and weight loss, as well as physical activity and exercise. He is best known for his work in three areas: abandoning rules and embracing risky play in his free range kids work; leading public discussion in flipping the food pyramid, by challenging the low fat nutrition dogma with low carb high fat diets; and developing national accounts of well-being through his Sovereign Well-being Index research.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "What will it take for societies to be truly innovative? What will it look like to have that decentralised, citizen powered and unbiased by demographics? Andy Crowe and Rui Peng's idea is to see underprivileged communities embrace their diversity and become powerhouses of innovation. This has upended their values, blown apart their assumptions, and given them an understanding of innovation as a force for good. Andy co-founded Critical. Design in 2013 with Rui Peng, aimed at democratising manufacturing. The Design Lab is located inside decile 1 Wesley Intermediate School and brings tech such as 3D design and printing, robotics and CNC milling to their students and community. Andy has supported innovative initiatives in the education sector and continues to help teachers to think outside of the box to best prepare students for an unknown future. He has harnessed this experience to drive the social innovation initiatives that Critical pursues.\n\nRui Peng is a husband, father, social entrepreneur, designer, maker, architect, technology enthusiast, and a man with a big mission. The question that guides his work and life is: ‘How can I align my deepest desire with the world’s deepest need?’ As a young designer based in the low socioeconomic neighbourhood of Mt Roskill, he is searching for the “sweet spot” where his talents can be directed towards empowering his neighbours to gain the skills and resources they need to determine their own futures. He co-founded Critical. Design in 2013 and right now, he’s working through the immense challenges that come with making the dream of the social entrepreneur a reality.

He came to filmmaking the long way, spending the first ten years of his working life mustering, shearing, fishing and fencing. Over this time he developed a strong connection to the land and the people that work on it and this bond remained even with his shift to film and television.\n\nPeter has credits in well over a hundred documentaries, among them; BBC's Blue Planet series, a documentary on giant squids for prime time Discovery, episodes on the South Island for Country Calendar, the acclaimed TVNZ series Explorers, and the final tribute documentary for Sir Edmund Hillary. Peter has also produced and filmed the award winning TVNZ series Hunger for the Wild and is now working on his second series of Coasters. \n\nHaving recently completed his first feature documentary The Last Ocean, this five year labour of love has expanded into the formation of a Charitable Trust to promote the protection of the world's most pristine marine ecosystem -- the Ross Sea in Antarctica.\n\nhttp://www.lastocean.org/\n\nhttp://www.tedxauckland.com/\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized eventIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

Her award winning research into the applications of aquaponics won her the Prime Minister’s Future Scientist award, and at the age of 18 she started her own business, Root Aquaponics, where she hopes to start selling aquaponic units she designed to homes and schools in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nAn environmentalist at heart, Georgia has led sustainability expos to educate others on the importance of future proofing today’s industries, and has been invited as a guest speaker at community events.

The top chess players in the world are not humans OR computers, but combinations of humans AND computers. In this talk, Sean Gourley examines this world of augmented intelligence and shows how our understanding of the human brain is shaping the way we visualize and interact with big data.

    "description": "10 days before delivering his talk at TEDxAuckland 2017, conservationist Captain Pete Bethune was knifed in the chest while chasing wildlife smugglers in the Amazon. In one of most emotional speeches you will hear, Pete argues that we can all lead extraordinary and meaningful lives, but the key is to find and stand for a cause you truly believe in. From serving months in a maximum security prison for fighting Japanese whalers, to saving endangered red monkeys from poachers in the Amazon, Pete Bethune’s story will thrill, move, and inspire you.\n Pete Bethune takes conservation to the extreme. As the founder of Earthrace Conservation, Pete is a world record holder, circling the globe four times on his powerboat Earthrace. His missions have seen him shot at, run over by a Japanese security vessel, incarcerated in Libya and Japan, and held under armed guard in a Guatemalan Military camp.\n\nAs the producer of his show ‘The Operatives’, Pete runs a team of former special forces operatives to combat wildlife poaching, smuggling and illegal fishing in Africa, Asia and Central America. He also works closely with government enforcement units training them in coastal surveillance and hostile vessel takedown. At the heart of it all, Pete is a ship captain with an environmental edge.

    "description": "One one level, the Modern Māori Quartet was formed to bring to the stage the easygoing vibe its founders remember from their parents' casual, guitar-fuelled garage parties of the 70s and 80s. At a deeper level, though, the MMQ's performance and talk challenges the way indigenous peoples are perceived in Western society and uses an ancient culture to build a bridge any audience can cross. \n\nThe suave crooners from the award-winning Modern Māori Quartet invite you to enjoy a fresh take on the classic Māori showbands of yesteryear.\r\n\r\nToi Whakaari: New Zealand Drama School alumni James Tito, Maaka Pohatu, Matariki Whatarau and Francis Kora bring the concept of a Māori Rat Pack into the present with a contemporary twist, weaving their acting and musical talents together to fuse hearty and humorous Māori storytelling with the glorious tradition of showband entertainment.\r\n\r\nModern Māori Quartet blends old school charm with modern pizzazz to highlight Aotearoa New Zealand’s musical past and present, featuring unique spins on Māori waiata (song), showband hits and pop music, all infused with the multi-talented Māori foursome’s irresistible charisma, sublime harmonies and universal humour.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

What practical steps should we consider in preparation for this? Might we view the discovery of primitive and advanced alien life differently? What can we learn from our own historical interactions between first nation peoples and ‘alien’ colonists?\n\nSteve Pointing is Professor of Applied Ecology at Auckland University of Technology and director of the university’s Institute for Applied Ecology New Zealand. He pioneered the use of molecular techniques to understand how simple microbes cling to life in extreme environments such as the icy deserts of Antarctica, boiling geothermal pools and lakes that are ten times more salty than the ocean. This led to interest from NASA astrobiologists, those who seek to understand if life could exist beyond Earth, since the harsh conditions mimic those encountered on the surface of other planets.

    "description": "Why is something as useful as hemp so underutilised in so many developed countries? How can we use this “companion plant” to benefit society? Founder of the hemp seed food product company, Plant Culture, Cameron Sims explores these questions, detailing the history of hemp prohibition, and how this has held society back from being more sustainable. Cameron lists the many benefits and uses of hemp, from eating it for breakfast to building environmentally friendly houses, showing us how we can begin harnessing the power of hemp pragmatically in order to improve our own lives and the world around us.    Cameron Sims believes the simple ingredient hemp, is the key to changing the world and helping humanity become more sustainable. As a Kiwi raised on a sheep and beef farm, he became New Zealand’s first hemp-based chef.\n\nCameron’s company Plant Culture encourages and supports consumers to be environmentally friendly. His ultimate goal is to create a modern and biodynamic university campus to reintroduce biodiversity back into our cities and soils. Cameron’s passions are plant-based cuisine, art, nature, environmental enterprise, adventure, extreme sports, meditation, breathing, yoga and people.

So how can parents make money tangible to their children? James's approach centres on a \"cashless moneybox,\" designed to make money seem real and help children understand the tangibility of money. \n\nJames is the Chief Architect at ASB bank and father of three young children.\r\n\r\nAs a father, James has a keen interest in financial literacy and the challenge of teaching new generations about money. He believes that as money becomes less tangible in our digital world, we need to find new ways of using technology to impart good money habits to our kids in order to increase their financial well-being.\r\n\r\nAt ASB James is helping the 168-year-old bank to rethink itself as a tech company, licensed and trusted to provide financial services.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "How Hong has managed to fight blindness with 20$ and a smart phone and in the process is changing how we think and create medical equipment.\n\nDr. Hong Sheng Chiong is currently an eye doctor in Gisborne hospital. He completed his clinical training in Ireland before he crossed over to New Zealand where he initially worked as a registrar in neurosurgery and general surgery before he stepped into the world of eye. His main interests are eye regenerative medicine, bioengineering and telemedicine. His exposure to third world medicine in Kenya, Nepal and Malaysia have given him the insight to the burden of preventable blindness. He believes the problem lies in the access to quality eye care. In 2014, he founded OphthalmicDocs, an R&D company that focuses on the development of ultra mobile and economical eye tests and diagnostics devices. He has invented several eye imaging adapters that can be used in conjunction with a mobile application to diagnose and monitor eye diseases. Fighting preventable blindness is his career's primary mission.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    "description": "In this talk, Richie Hardcore examines some of the ongoing and problematic behaviours of men, and how our current ideas of masculinity perpetuate this. By pinpointing cultural influences that have generated unhealthy concepts of masculinity, Richie shows how we can unlearn these behaviours, and begin to nurture a healthy masculine identity in our society.  Richie Hardcore is a board member at White Ribbon New Zealand, Ministry of Social Development 'It's Not Ok’ Champion, working to end men's violence against women. He is an educator and public speaker, focusing on exploring masculinity and ending rape culture, sexual and family violence.\n\nHe also speaks passionately about mental health and wellness, and as a former alcohol and drug harm reduction community worker, on how we can address AOD issues in our society. He was a radio host at Auckland’s 95bfm for 15 years, conducting interviews with politicians, personalities and musicians alike, as well as DJing music. He also was a rotating host of NewsTalk ZB's mental health talk back radio show ‘The Nutters Club', and today is a regular feature on shows such as TVNZ breakfast as a social commentator. A retired former multiple Muay Thai Champion, with over 25 years in martial arts, Richie is now a trainer, having helped some of New Zealand's most accomplished fighters achieve their goals.

    "description": "Multi-disciplinary artist, Jahra 'Rager' Wasasala discusses her journey to understanding the complexities and internal conflicts of her identity and the world around her. As an artist, she has found that one way she explores this is through the use of her body with dance. Despite the discussed conflicts being incredibly personal to her, they are completely universal, as these are conflicts we can all admit to struggling with at one point, continually, or continuously. Jahra ends this talk with a moving and experimental piece that combines dance and poetry to express these ideas.  Jahra ‘Rager’ Wasasala is an award-winning cross-disciplinary artist of Fijian/NZ European descent. As an artist, Jahra investigates her ancestral connections through the art mediums of performance activation, contemporary dance and poetry, and has extensively toured her performance works both nationally and internationally.\n\nAs a child of the Pasifika diaspora, Jahra is invested in translating her shared internal conflict into an accessible, yet confrontational, physicalised language. Her most recent performance work titled “a world, with your wound in it” focuses on the complex relationship between the earth and a woman’s body, a theme Jahra continues to investigate in her developing work.\n\nJahra is known for her transcendent performance presence, otherworldly physicality and potent poetry, as well as her bold approach to political and social themes both on and off the stage. Jahra found her voice through the physical arts and believes that they are intrinsically tied to reclaiming autonomy, reconnecting to your ancestors and changing the world around you.

    "description": "Shaveer Mirpuri has led distinguished multinational companies to create the future of their industry using his theory. Executing this novel methodology very quickly yielded two new award winning AI startups of international repute. It's an original business contribution, of ground up collaboration with one’s competitor, that has large significance and applicability to anyone in the field of entrepreneurship, democratising technologies, and corporate innovation. Drawn from his exec-experience in high profile tech companies and venture capital, we hear a casual and light hearted distillation of how to create unfair advantage in business; an ecosystem where the majority's status quo is to disrupt or compete with one another in isolation.  Shaveer Mirpuri is in the business of disruptive startups with the purpose of driving innovation. Upon his return to New Zealand, Shaveer formed GOAT Ventures which co-invests and co-creates companies with Fortune 500 corporates. He believes pairing radically opposite companies will create opportunities others could only dream of.\n\nHe’s been involved in hugely successful startups such as Wooga which grew to 300 staff and raised $24 million, he’s taken lead mentoring roles. He’s also personally consulted the CEO of Walmart on artificial intelligence strategy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on innovation.

    "description": "\"Deep technology are innovations that have the potential to advance technological frontiers\", however, in recent years, digital technology and software have disproportionately taken up the public's interests. In her talk, Imche Fourie discusses why investors are prioritising digital over deep tech, and argues that while digital is important, we need to put more interest in deep tech if we want to solve the big issues of our world.    Imche is passionate about accelerating New Zealand’s science and technology industries. She works with young deep technology start-ups as GM of the technology incubator, Level Two, and is an advocate for investing in technologies that solve global problems. She also believes in the importance of teaching soft skills and commercial know-how to hard science students and does so as CEO of education-focused charity, Chiasma. Though she is supporter of all facets of deep technology, she has a background and particular interest in biotechnology ventures. She sits on a number of investment committees and is a mentor to several young entrepreneurs.

    "description": "The concept of change is simple. It is the place between something stopping and something beginning, the hardest part is making the change stick. In this talk Nigel Parker shares a personal story of change where he creates a digital assistant that passively collects his health data and makes predictions when he is going off track. The assistant can predict when he is getting stressed or fighting a virus, and can give him a nudge at the right place and right time to adjust his behaviours. Nigel Parker is chief engineer for Microsoft Asia’s Commercial Software Engineering. His job is to seek out solutions to hard problems. But for him, it’s not just about the technology, it’s about the impact technology can have on people’s lives. In his own personal project, Nigel set about using technology to turn his health around and create better, stable habits.\n\nNigel believes as machine intelligence becomes more developed, humans must make sure they keep up and build symbiotic intelligence to expand human capability in ways that are both tangible and magical.

    "description": "In recent years, the South Korean media industry has become a global phenomenon. Anna Faber’s psychoanalytic research of South Korean media, it’s inception, development, and success draws controversial and challenging ideas about the impact of the industry on contemporary society, and its significance in the foundation of a nationwide establishment of normativity.\n Anna Faber is a Master’s student at The University of Auckland researching the interaction between the US and Asia within a film context. In particular, her world-first research explores the impact South Korean film and media has on South Korean society. Notoriously censored in the past, South Korean film has underscored major political movements and provided somewhat of a guideline to South Korean existence.\n\nAnna was awarded a first class honours degree in which she undertook various studies in feminist film theory and documentary-making in addition to a dissertation on the concept of borders in South Korean horror film.

Razowsky's compelling talk reminds you that you already have all you need to respond to life’s challenges. For David Razowsky, all that matters is now. The respected Los Angeles-based improv guru has performed and directed in 10 Chicago Second City revues with the likes of Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Saturday Night Live alum Rachel Dratch and Amy Sedaris as well as being artistic director of The Second City Los Angeles for a decade. David’s philosophy is this: Your present awareness is the only thing you need to create compelling, smart, truthful, and surprising scenes. No games, no preconceived premises, no ideas, no ego.\n\nAs well hosting a weekly drop-in class when he’s not taking his improv around the world, he hosts the podcast ADD Comedy with Dave Razowsky. He is a consultant for Dreamworks, a teacher for Steppenwolf Theater, professor for California State University, and he directed two productions for Amsterdam’s Boom Chicago Theatre. David’s  also a member of the Reduced Shakespeare Company. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The stunning photographs of the children alongside the conversations with their parents are presented in the Super Power Baby Project, a photographic art book due for launch in August 2014.\r\n\r\nThe Super Power Baby Project is a life affirming work. It does not shy from the notion that genetic syndromes bring with them their share of challenge, grief and difficulty. The strong message is though that there is much that lies beyond that. Rachel demonstrates that these children have much to teach us about themselves and ourselves, which is to be celebrated as truly exceptional.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

Shaun is an advocate for multi-disciplinary research and teaching, and lectures in the University of Auckland’s Department of Physics and the University’s Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. His interest in innovation led him to co-author the 2013 book, “Get Off the Grass” with the late Sir Paul Callaghan. Shaun believes that the challenge for New Zealand - if we want to base our economy on knowledge rather than nature - is to overcome our relatively small and widely dispersed population base and build a city of four million people. To do this, we'll need to start trusting each other more so that our ideas will spread, and we'll need the infrastructure that connects us. If we can do this it would make us one of the most innovative places on the planet.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

This visa is run by the Edmund Hillary Fellowship (www.ehf.org) in a new model for taking a human-centric and entrepreneurial approach to doing immigration in the 21st century. \n Yoseph is co-founder and CEO of the Edmund Hillary Fellowship, a community of exceptional entrepreneurs and investors who are solving complex global problems from New Zealand. EHF is implementing the Global Impact Visa – the most entrepreneur-friendly visa in the world and the first to focus on impact.\n\nBorn in Ethiopia, Yoseph has lived in six countries across four continents. Before moving to New Zealand, he helped grow Inflection, a successful technology startup in Silicon Valley.

    "description": "Dave Boivin is a Transmedia Consultant and the founder of Deep Immersion, a New Zealand Transmedia solutions company. Cinema is Dave’s first love, a passion borne out of his days working long shifts at an Auckland multiplex. It was here that Dave observed first hand the powerful build-up and after-effect of the cinematic experience; he could see viewers searching for an opportunity to engage with the material before and after the screening.\n\nLong before Transmedia was a word, Dave began developing small stunt-based ‘happenings’ staged within the cinema complex that served to ‘compliment’ or ‘complicate’ the viewers experience of the film. And now – to cut a long story short – it’s what he does for a living.\n\nDeep Immersion helps creative producers and artists find exciting ways to give their stories life beyond the page, the stage, and the screen. Dave is constantly on the hunt for new narrative forms that can cross media platforms, embracing new audiences all over the world.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/D_immersion\nhttp://www.deepimmersion.net\nhttp://www.tedxauckland.com",

The Vend team hold three core values dearly in their hearts; to delight retailers, to do the impossible, and to take care of one another.\r\n\r\nVaughan also co-founded OMG Tech! an initiative to encourage kids of all backgrounds, genders, and ages to get into technology. It not only covers coding, but all newly developed technology such as robots, drones, nanotech, teleportation and hover-boards. They give kids the chance to explore and get inspired by technology that they will be experts in ten years from now.\r\n\r\nHe dreams big and likes to set himself impossible challenges; whether it is cycling the length of New Zealand solo, running 1,000 kilometres, or building a $100M venture.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",
