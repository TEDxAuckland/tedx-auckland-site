We are big on collaboration and community here at BizDojo, in-fact it is at the very core of what we do creating co-working spaces and communities across New Zealand. We started out with a belief that working together, and learning from one another unlocks opportunity far beyond what we can do as individuals; so it was a natural choice for us to partner with TEDxAuckland who embody this in all that they do. Their transformative, inspirational events super-charge the power of bringing people together, and we are glad that the BizDojo team and residents got to be part of that in 2018.
