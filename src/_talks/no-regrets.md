description_markdown: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently
  of the TED Conferences. Urzila talks about her life and how she came to be a comedian
  and her philosophy on giving things ago and having no regrets.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.urzilacarlson.com/\n\nNatural,
  cheeky and straight-up South African-born, New Zealand-based, Urzila Carlson, took
  to the stage for the first time in 2008, and has since racked up an impressive array
  of awards for her stand-up comedy.\r\n\r\nSome of the awards she holds to her name
  include Best Female Comedian at the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 NZ Comedy Guild Awards,
  as well as the coveted TV3 People’s Choice Award at the 2013 New Zealand International
  Comedy Festival.\r\n\r\nShe has also had 4 sold-out solo seasons (2010, 2011, 2012,
  2013) at the New Zealand International Comedy Festival, and was invited to Melbourne
  International Comedy Festival in 2013 where she had a hugely successful sell-out
  season and appeared on the televised Oxfam Comedy Gala and Comedy Up Late.\r\n\r\nUrzila
  is one of New Zealand’s funniest comedians, male or female, and is a true star on
  the rise.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas
  worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people
  together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live
  speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
  local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized
  TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
  individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"
