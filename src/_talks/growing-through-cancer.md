This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Rebecca has embraced a lifestyle of wellbeing as well as connecting with and supporting other women facing cancer. A chance friendship with raw foods “unbakery” Little Bird founder Megan May, buying a Vitamix and the essential addition of yoga marked a turning point in Rebecca’s journey and she has recently opened a yoga and wellness hub in Auckland. The Centre combines yoga, naturopathy, meditation, massage, acupuncture and nutrition and offers free programmes for women with cancer.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
