Peter Young established Fisheye Films in Christchurch in 1997 and has worked as a freelance director and cameraman. He came to filmmaking the long way, spending the first ten years of his working life mustering, shearing, fishing and fencing. Over this time he developed a strong connection to the land and the people that work on it and this bond remained even with his shift to film and television.

Peter has credits in well over a hundred documentaries, among them; BBC's Blue Planet series, a documentary on giant squids for prime time Discovery, episodes on the South Island for Country Calendar, the acclaimed TVNZ series Explorers, and the final tribute documentary for Sir Edmund Hillary. Peter has also produced and filmed the award winning TVNZ series Hunger for the Wild and is now working on his second series of Coasters. 

Having recently completed his first feature documentary The Last Ocean, this five year labour of love has expanded into the formation of a Charitable Trust to promote the protection of the world's most pristine marine ecosystem -- the Ross Sea in Antarctica.

About TEDx, x = independently organized eventIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
