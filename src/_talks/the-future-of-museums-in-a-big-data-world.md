In a story that weaves together an Arabian princess, the ancient Egyptians and Donald Trump, technology entrepreneur Angie Judge shares her unique perspective on the intersection of artificial intelligence in museums to democratise curation with data. Take a journey back in time at the history of history itself to see how museums have changed over the ages, a stark look at the perilous state of this sector and a view forward at the forces which are shaping our cultural future. 
 Angie Judge is a Kiwi technology entrepreneur revolutionising the museum experience. Her company Dexibit brings artificial intelligence into the world’s cultural institutions and has been recognised as the global leader in data science for the cultural sector. Her passion for history, art and science coupled with computer engineering and analytics inspires her to make data-driven insight accessible to all museums.

She writes on cultural commercialisation, lectures in machine learning and is a proud supporter of getting girls into STEM careers. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
