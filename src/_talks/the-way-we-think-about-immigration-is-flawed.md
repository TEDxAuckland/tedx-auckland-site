title: The way we think about immigration is flawed
youtube_video_id: 6Vqethhad_k
description_markdown: "Born in Ethiopia, Yoseph Ayele was kicked out of the United
  States because his Harvard degree and entrepreneurial work did not satisfy US immigration
  requirements. He moved to New Zealand to design the Global Impact Visa - the first
  immigration policy in the world to select people on their potential to create a
  positive impact in society. This visa is run by the Edmund Hillary Fellowship (www.ehf.org)
  in a new model for taking a human-centric and entrepreneurial approach to doing
  immigration in the 21st century. \n Yoseph is co-founder and CEO of the Edmund Hillary
  Fellowship, a community of exceptional entrepreneurs and investors who are solving
  complex global problems from New Zealand. EHF is implementing the Global Impact
  Visa – the most entrepreneur-friendly visa in the world and the first to focus on
  impact.\n\nBorn in Ethiopia, Yoseph has lived in six countries across four continents.
  Before moving to New Zealand, he helped grow Inflection, a successful technology
  startup in Silicon Valley. He studied entrepreneurship, leadership and social change
  at Harvard, Cambridge, and Victoria University of Wellington. He is passionate about
  regenerative agriculture, building cultural bridges, and community. This talk was
  given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized
  by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx"
