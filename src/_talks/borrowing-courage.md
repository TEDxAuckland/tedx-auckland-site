This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. At just 14 years old, Muskan has published two books and hosts her own radio show, despite being born with several serious medical conditions.

Muskan Devta is a bright, bubbly, and brave fourteen-year-old who has achieved much in her short life. Muskan was born with a medical condition called partial hemiplegia. Her right side is weaker than her left and for 13 years she had to wear a brace to keep her foot straight. Being a special needs child gave her a lot of challenges, but Muskan proved that she could overcome them by focusing on the positives.

Coming to New Zealand at age 4, Muskan is currently a student of Westlake Girls High School. She has been an radio host, column writer and author of two books, including her autobiography written to raise funds for Starship Hospital; the book ‘I Dream’ is now part of her school’s Year 9 curriculum. With the support of her family, school, and hospital, Muskan is very successful today. She is on a journey to make people realise that being a child with a disability does not mean you are different.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
