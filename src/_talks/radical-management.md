description_markdown: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently
  of the TED Conferences. Loomio is an online tool for collective decision making
  that is transformative in it's approach to management of companies, groups or community
  organisations. Loomio is hitting a sweet spot between individual voice and collective
  decision making.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.loomio.org/\r\nhttp://maidaborn.com/\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com/\n\nVivien
  is the co-founder of the exciting Loomio Cooperative, an organization born from
  activists in the Occupy movement collaborating with Enspiral, the social enterprise
  network. Vivian is passionate about working with other people to find scalable solutions
  to the wicked problems of our time: poverty, equitable access to education, clean
  water, and sustainable local economies. She brings experience in decision making,
  social change and a depth of knowledge in organisational systems.\r\n\r\nVivien
  believes a whole new set of opportunities for the world arises from the intersection
  of online citizenship and democracy. Her personal mantra is that ‘a group of people
  with diverse experiences and perspectives will come up with solutions better than
  any one person ever could have’. Vivian is inquiring into the nature of collaboration,
  into the power of the crowd, and what invites people into engaged citizenship.\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
