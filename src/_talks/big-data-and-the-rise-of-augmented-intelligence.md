youtube_video_id: mKZCa_ejbfg
description_markdown: "Dr. Sean Gourley is the founder and CTO of Quid. He is a Physicist
  by training and has studied the mathematical patterns of war and terrorism. This
  research has taken him all over the world from the Pentagon, to the United Nations
  and Iraq. Previously, Sean worked at NASA on self-repairing nano-circuits and is
  a two-time New Zealand track and field champion. Sean is now based in San Francisco
  where he is building tools to augment human intelligence.\n\nDescription of Talk:\nEach
  year computers are getting faster, but at the same time we as humans are getting
  better at using them. The top chess players in the world are not humans OR computers,
  but combinations of humans AND computers. In this talk, Sean Gourley examines this
  world of augmented intelligence and shows how our understanding of the human brain
  is shaping the way we visualize and interact with big data. Gourley argues that
  the world we are living in is too complex for any single human mind to understand
  and that we need to team up with machines to make better decisions.\n\nhttp://seangourley.com/

  organized event\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local,
  self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.
  At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion
  and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded
  TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general
  guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject
