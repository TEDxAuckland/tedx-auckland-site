Richard took over the reins of Big Buddy in 2002. His belief is the strength of human caring; he believes passionately that humans step up with less bureaucracy, judgement or expectation to make far better outcomes socially for us all.

Richard put his IT and business skills to good use when he bailed out of the corporate world and took over the reins of Big Buddy in 2002. It’s taken focus, will-power and trust to grow an organisation that matches male volunteers with fatherless boys.

But Richard’s source lies in the values of the hippy movement he grew out of – his strongest belief is around the strength of human caring; he believes passionately that most anyone and anything can be healed when humans step up to care deeply for each other without judgement or expectation.

Richard is also chair of Consumer NZ, a Vodafone World of Difference award winner and is a passionate father, grandfather, celebrant, gardener and author.
