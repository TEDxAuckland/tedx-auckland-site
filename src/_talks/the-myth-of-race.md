Sharad argues that the modern perception of race is wrong and that science and the story of Vitamin D and Folic acid tell their own story about race and skin colour.

Dr. Sharad P. Paul is an academic specialising in skin cancer surgery, both in New Zealand and Australia. His Skin Surgery Clinic has one of the largest series of skin cancer patients worldwide, with over 100,000 consultations and 35,000 operations since the clinic was established in 1996.

Award winning Sharad has served on the National Commission of UNESCO, and teaches creative writing to disadvantaged children by personally visiting schools once a week, and by funding school libraries. These initiatives are supported through the model of social entrepreneurship created by projects such as The Baci Lounge, an award-winning bookstore, within his own Baci Foundation.
