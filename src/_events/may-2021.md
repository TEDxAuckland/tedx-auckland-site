From the shadows of 2020, TEDxAuckland 2021 is a celebration of new ideas, innovative solutions, pushing boundaries to create the kind of world we all want to live in.

Driven by passion and curiosity, our mission is to encourage dialogue and engagement, create inclusive spaces and foster debate and discussion that continues long after the event.

Hosted at Life Central in Mt Eden, a state of the art, large capacity event and performance centre.

Youâ€™ll experience 15+ incredible talks and performances during an immersive, full day program. Extended breaks provide ample opportunities to meet fellow attendees, taste delicious food prepared by local Chefs, discuss the talks and meet speakers from this and previous years events.
