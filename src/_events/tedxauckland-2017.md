This year weâ€™re back at the Aotea Centre for our 2nd multi-day festival. Join us for 21 talks from local and international speakers, food, fun and partner activations.

TEDxAuckland is an Ideas Festival. Get ready to be inspired and challenged by local and international people changing the world with their unique ideas, and in the breaks get chatting to the equally incredible attendees around you!

Food and drink during the event is included in your Multi-Day Pass and on Saturday evening, once the talks are done, another experience awaits VIP ticket holders.

**The Program**

The Festival opens at 3pm Friday for registrations and activations. The first talks start at 5.00pm through to 7pm.

The Friday night Burger Banquet is made by: Tiger Burger / Wise Boys / Judge Bao / Ralphs / Bird on a wire

On Saturday the Festival opens at 9.30am with the first talks beginning at 10am.<br>Lunch on Saturday is made by Eat My Lunch, thanks to Fonterra.

The talks will conclude around 5pm on Saturday. Those attending the sold out VIP SocialDinner will jump on a bus (provided) for a 5 course dinner produced by some amazing local chefs. Matched with local beer and wine.

Those keen to kick on are invited to join TEDx crew, speakers and friends at Sweat Shop Brew Kitchen, Sale St, Freemans Bay after 9pm.
