2016 TEDxAuckland was a little different. We curated ideas for a global audience; global in their diversity, expertise and residence. Say hello to TEDxAuckland 2016!

Our Theme this year is:&nbsp;*flipside*

* The perspective you get from seeing an old problem in a new way.
* Turning hierarchies on their head and putting ideas ahead of ideology.
* Sidestepping power structures, gender, race and geography.
* Stepping outside your workplace, your country and even your hemisphere to connect with a community of speakers, delegates and partners united by a healthy disrespect for business as usual.

The event featured ideas and talks from amazing people changing the world. Weâ€™ll be matching the diversity of ideas with an equally diverse audience, you!

TEDxAuckland 2016:&nbsp;*flipside*&nbsp;featured talks over two days, events, activities and social time. Shed 10 the venue provided the perfect space for hosting, break out spaces and food and beverage side you deserve.
