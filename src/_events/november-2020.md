# TEDxAuckland November 2020

TEDxAuckland 2020 is back at Whoa\! Studios and The Grounds. This amazing, intimate event is an exceptional confluence of ideas, networking, incredible culinary experience and after party.

Every year typically has a few defining moments, but the past nine months have contained so many world-changing, paradigm-shifting developments that it’s getting hard to believe we’re not in a simulation that’s running every possible scenario at once.

But there’s no time to be exhausted: With a pandemic still raging, waves of social change swelling around the globe, there’s still a lot of history left to be made in 2020.

At TEDxAuckland, we’ll be part of the making history part and the making sense of it part. We’ll be one of the very few, live in person TEDx events taking place in the world and we’d love you to be part of it.

We’ll be hosted by Whoa Studios in Henderson with an exceptional dining experience, provided by the eponymous Ben Bayly of the Grounds and Ahi Restaurant in Commercial Bay.

We have an incredible line up of 5 speakers, a 5 course dinner and a once in a life opportunity to say, “I was there”.

Please join us at Whoa Studios on Saturday 14th November 2020 for a night you’ll never forget in a year you’d like to forget.
