# TEDxAuckland November 2020

**TEDxAuckland** is back at Whoa\! Studios and The Grounds. Get ready for an exceptional confluence of ideas, networking, and culinary experience (and of course the famous after-party).

Every year typically has a few defining moments, but 2020 has outdone itself. It’s been a year of world-changing, paradigm-shifting development… and it’s only October. With a pandemic still raging and waves of social change swelling around the globe, there’s still a lot of history left to be made in 2020.

Join the conversation, as we make history - and make sense of it. We’ll be one of the very few, live in person TEDx events taking place in the world and we’d love you to be part of it.

We’ll be hosted by Whoa\! Studios in Henderson with an exceptional dining experience, provided by the eponymous [Ben Bayly](https://benbayly.co.nz) of [The Grounds](https://thegrounds.co.nz) and [Ahi Restaurant](https://www.ahirestaurant.co.nz) in Commercial Bay.

We have an incredible line up of 5 speakers and a 5 course dinner. With only 150 places available, get in quick to be a part of it.

Join us at Whoa\! Studios on Saturday 14th November 2020 for a night you’ll never forget in a year you’d like to forget.
