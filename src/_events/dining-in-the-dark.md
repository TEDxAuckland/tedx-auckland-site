# Introducing A World First

On August 31st, TEDxAuckland is hosting a Salon event which will be the first TEDx event in the world to be held in **complete darkness**.

Hosted by Dans le Noir ? Rydges Auckland and shared with you by Vodafone NZ - this will be an unforgettable experience like no other.

#### TEDxAuckland and Dans le Noir ? are combining to provide you with a unique sensory, social and human experience.

**A Sensory Journey:&nbsp;**Dining in absolute darkness is a sensory experience that awakens senses and enables guests to completely re-evaluate their perception of taste and smell.

**A Place to Socialise:&nbsp;**Darkness eradicates shyness & erases preconceptions. Communication becomes more intense, authentic and spontaneous. Both with the people you sit with, and the TEDxAuckland speakers.

**A Unique Human Experience:&nbsp;**Blind people work not only as waitstaff but also as guides during this experience. Reversing roles, the guide becomes patronsâ€™ eyes for the time of the dinner\!

#### Event Information:

* Enjoy a three course meal, with 3 different menu versions freshly created for this experience.
* 2x Speakers will present in pitch black between meal courses.
* Just like the food, information about the speakers has been hidden so attendee's go into the event with zero preconceptions.
* **When**\: Saturday August 31st starting 6pm till late.
* **Where**\: Dans le Noir ? Rydges Auckland.
* **Price**\: $199.
* The event will be followed by an afterparty at The Glass Goose.
