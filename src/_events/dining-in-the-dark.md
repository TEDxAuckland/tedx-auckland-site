# Introducing A World First

On August 31st, TEDxAuckland is hosting a Salon event which will be the first TEDx event in the world to be held in complete darkness.

Hosted by Dining in the Dark and shared with you by Vodafone NZ - this will be an unforgettable experience like no other.

#### TEDxAuckland and Dining in the Dark are combining to provide you with a unique sensory, social and human experience.

**A Sensory Journey:&nbsp;**Dining in absolute darkness is a sensory experience that awakens senses and enables guests to completely re-evaluate their perception of taste and smell.

**A Place to Socialise:&nbsp;**Darkness eradicates shyness & erases preconceptions. Communication becomes more intense, authentic and spontaneous. Both with the people you sit with, and the TEDxAuckland speakers.

**A Unique Human Experience:&nbsp;**Blind people work not only as waitstaff but also as guides during this experience. Reversing roles, the guide becomes patronsâ€™ eyes for the time of the dinner\!

#### Event Information:

* Enjoy a three course meal: With 3 different menu versions freshly created for this experience - 'trust the chef', seafood and vegan.
* Speakers will present in pitch black between meal courses.
* When: Saturday August 31st staring at 6pm
* Price: $249
* The event will be followed by an afterparty at the Glass Goose
