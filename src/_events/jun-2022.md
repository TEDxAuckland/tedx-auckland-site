Following the challenges we’ve all faced over the past year we invite you to share in the optimistic ideas that will reshape and refocus New Zealand in the years to come. Five speakers will take centre stage at the special matinée styled TEDxAuckland *together*.

In the break meet fellow attendees, taste delicious food prepared by local Chefs, discuss the talks and meet the speakers.
