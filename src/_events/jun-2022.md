Following the challenges we’ve all faced over the past year we invite you to share in the optimistic ideas that will reshape and refocus New Zealand in the years to come. Seven speakers will take centre stage at TEDxAuckland JUN 2022 with an evening event.

An extended session break provides ample opportunities to meet fellow attendees, taste delicious food prepared by local Chefs, discuss the talks and meet the speakers.

Join us as we embrace 2022 to build a promising vision for the future at Auckland’s TEDx styled, ASB Waterfront Theatre.
