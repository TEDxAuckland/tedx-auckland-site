Press Release: TEDxAucklnzd<br />
TEDxAuckland Returns with another Stellar Line-Up for 2015</p>
<p>TEDxAuckland is back for another year of inspiring stories and ideas worth talking about.</p>
<p>The first round of confirmed speakers are: Riley &amp; Steve Hathaway of Young Ocean Explorers, Billie Jordan, founder of dance sensations Hip Op-eration, Dr Siouxsie Willis, a Bioluminescence expert, Shaun Hendy of Te Pūnaha Matatini, Lisa Matissoo-Smith, Professor of Biological Anthropology, Sir Bob Harvey, respected leader in both creative arts and politics, and Janette Searle, founder of ‘Take My Hands’.</p>
<p>The event, which will be held on Saturday, May 2nd at the Victory Convention Centre, is designed to open Aucklanders’ minds to new ideas through storytelling, sustainable-thinking and innovation. It comes off the back of exciting and hugely successful sold-out past TEDxAuckland events.</p>
<p>Organiser Elliott Blade is continuing to build on the momentum, further solidifying the platform that sees New Zealanders’ innovative ideas and stories told on the global TEDx stage.</p>
<p>“TEDxAuckland has become the leading platform and pipeline for the propagation of New Zealand ideas, creativity, innovation and culture to the rest of the world” says Blade.</p>
<p>“Our mission at TEDxAuckland is to make it the Pacific’s leading platform of great ideas, storytelling, creativity and actionable innovation to the rest of the world; to create and foster a sense of community amongst the people and organisations who have gathered (and continue to gather) around this event and to provide a cultural focus and impetus for conversation and debate”.</p>
<p>Previous TEDxAuckland talks featured on YouTube have garnered over 1 million hits, with stories such as Paul Wood’s ‘What’s Your Prison?’ receiving over 120,000 views alone.<br />
Dr. Michelle Dickinson, another 2012 speaker, was recently awarded the Prime Minister's Science Media Communication Prize, and recently started a new initiative with 2014 speaker Vaughan Rowsell, (CEO &amp; Founder of Vend), called OMGTech!, a program that seeks to provide technology training to kids, opening up a world of future tech to Kiwis.</p>
<p>It is these initiatives and community that highlights the TEDxAuckland legacy. While only a few years old, it continues to be a launch pad for world-changing kiwi ideas worth spreading.</p>
<p>With an already stellar line up and further speakers to be announced, TEDxAuckland 2015 will be a not-to-miss event. Tickets go on sale, Wednesday March 11th on EventFinder – click here for details.</p>
