> How would you describe the show ‘I Am Rachel Chu’?

‘I Am Rachel Chu’ is a semi improvised and devised theater show based off the book and film Crazy Rich Asians. We’ve taken the story and rearranged it, taken bits out and then have put our own personal stories into it. It’s my story to an extent, but predominantly the story of the three main cast members Angela, Ravi and Amanda.

The audience will get to re-experience the story of ‘Crazy Rich Asians’, but with these tanginces and interruptions. Sometimes these interruptions aren’t just personal stories, but games (spontaneous theater games, and improvised games). There's also some audience interaction which breaks the fourth wall by acknowledging the audience.

> Why did you specifically choose to base your play off ‘Crazy Rich Asians’?&nbsp;

It seemed important because last year Crazy Rich Asians was such a big cultural phenomenon. It was in the media a lot and even people who aren’t plugged into the Arts (the average consumer) were also really aware of it.&nbsp;

The reason Crazy Rich Asians felt so relevant, important and the perfect template for our show is because it's very existence questions Asian media representation. It became the King or Queen of representation, and still is to an extent because it’s the largest Asian cast blockbuster in existence, in terms of ‘Big Hollywood Scale’. So, there are all these conversations about what it did well, what it represented, what it was representing and saying and what it was doing for the community. As an all-asian cast did we feel represented in this piece of media and in asking that question, what sort of ideas and problems and conundrums do we come up with?&nbsp;

> Who are you representing in the story?

Millennials, and Asians who are predominantly assimilated or westernized. In a funny way, the stories we’re telling are the same audiences that would have gone to see ‘Crazy Rich Asians’. We are telling the story of the average young Asian who's been born or raised in a western country. We’re not necessarily of high income, and predominantly work in the Arts so not necessarily the model minority. We are the Asians that you don't often get to see on TV, and probably meet an Auckland a lot of the time but don't see represented on our screens. We’re real people with real stories. That's not to say that we don't overlap with stereotypes, we do but it's also the ways that we don't overlap with those stereotypes. So we're just your can like next door Asian in a way.&nbsp;

I think it serves Auckland really well because it is such a fascinating Melting Pot like culture right now is kind of at an all-time high when it comes to the overlap, the intersections between different POC communities and different POC artistic communities and I think the rest of New Zealand doesn't have that same, very few cities in the world have the same level of cultural collision going on. It is intense and it's really beautiful and scary for a lot of people. Like I think it gives me a lot of life and you learn so much about people because of culture and you learn so much about yourself because of culture. So when youre in a city that is fertile ground for cultural investigation cultural diversity cultural interrogation a work like this actually feels inevitable and I do think yeah, maybe this work couldn't exist anywhere else.

I don't know if that's for sure but it does feel specifically tied to where auckland or where a big Metropolitan city. Yeah, but then that's why the like I can really see that distinction. Yeah, I don't think it would like this exists in Christchurch may be enlightened, but I don't see the same level of Asian diaspora and Wellington. You know who's here? It's Auckland is a city that really speaks to Crazy Rich Asians and has a conversation with it. And I am Rachel chu to is a product of that conversation.

> Take us through the journey from the first version of the play at the Fringe Festival till now. How are you approaching the narrative the second time? Why is it different from the last time?&nbsp;

The first time was pretty rushed, stressful, and hectic. We would go through the book predominantly and then occasionally reference the film to figure out what the pivotal moments in the story were and what our own versions of that were so for instance the process was us going. “Hey Rachel experiences this, how do we experience it and replacing in switching it around and then finding games to represent certain things. Like Rachel calling her mom becomes a game where we call or one of the cast members calls their loved one.&nbsp;

It was pretty mashed up and the actors were learning as it was being made, and never had much time to sit with the themes or ideas as much as we would have liked to. The second time around we got funding and the big question was how do we deepen our own understanding of the text, games, and themes. The rehearsal process now involves a dramaturg and with that we've kind of gotten the actors to really question why their stories are valuable and what it is about their own stories that they want to tell so even if the text isn't massively different. Hopefully their own understanding of it are what they bring to it is. The set design and design elements overall are slightly more polished and speak to the themes a bit more as well. So I guess the idea is hopefully it is deeper, more meaningful, makes more sense as a cohesive whole.

> Why did you choose these 3 actors to work?&nbsp;

I do think their stories are as valuable as the Hollywood narrative that we're spoon-fed. And are good enough to actually be a Hollywood story. It's just that they don't fit into the paradigms of what we expect. Ravi, Angela and Amanda are people that I recognize and know every day not to say that they're not unique in their own way, but I see&nbsp; Asians like them all the time and they have so much character and personality. You have so many interesting quirks, nuances, and your life, your choices fascinate me and I think they bring that on stage with them, into the work, the text, the games and you watch them and you go you are so extraordinary. And yeah, I think that comes through hopefully in the games and the show.

> What do you hope the audience takes away from this show?&nbsp;

I think the Asians that like us are coming to the show because they are hungry for alternative, and versions of themselves. They don't often get to see and I hope they come away with it going. Yes. My story is valuable and actually maybe I will tell my own story and maybe what I see with something like crazy Rich Asians isn't the end game. It's just like the beginning and that's the thing, none of us involved in this process dislike the film,&nbsp; not actively I think some of us are kind of indifferent at worst.

But I think we can come away&nbsp; from it and go that's awesome. And it's doing a great thing. But this is just a small piece of the puzzle. There is so much to us there so many dimensions that are yet to be conveyed, or there's so many dimensions we are yet to see. I hope people come away going. Yeah. I can't wait to see more Asian stories and more different alternative Asian stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I Am Rachel Chu isn't the end of a conversation is just the start of one in the same way Crazy Rich Asians is just the start of a conversation about the sort of work we want to see.

We're living in a really awesome time as Asian artists, as artists who are culturally aware, sensitive and savvy. I think that are best for even better works even more diverse even more unique works at stories that have never been told before can exist. We are sowing the seeds for that and that's quite exciting.
