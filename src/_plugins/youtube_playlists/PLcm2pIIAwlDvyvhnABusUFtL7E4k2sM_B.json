What will it look like to have that decentralised, citizen powered and unbiased by demographics? Andy Crowe and Rui Peng's idea is to see underprivileged communities embrace their diversity and become powerhouses of innovation. This has upended their values, blown apart their assumptions, and given them an understanding of innovation as a force for good. Andy co-founded Critical. Design in 2013 with Rui Peng, aimed at democratising manufacturing. The Design Lab is located inside decile 1 Wesley Intermediate School and brings tech such as 3D design and printing, robotics and CNC milling to their students and community. Andy has supported innovative initiatives in the education sector and continues to help teachers to think outside of the box to best prepare students for an unknown future. He has harnessed this experience to drive the social innovation initiatives that Critical pursues.\n\nRui Peng is a husband, father, social entrepreneur, designer, maker, architect, technology enthusiast, and a man with a big mission. The question that guides his work and life is: ‘How can I align my deepest desire with the world’s deepest need?’ As a young designer based in the low socioeconomic neighbourhood of Mt Roskill, he is searching for the “sweet spot” where his talents can be directed towards empowering his neighbours to gain the skills and resources they need to determine their own futures. He co-founded Critical. Design in 2013 and right now, he’s working through the immense challenges that come with making the dream of the social entrepreneur a reality.

Executing this novel methodology very quickly yielded two new award winning AI startups of international repute. It's an original business contribution, of ground up collaboration with one’s competitor, that has large significance and applicability to anyone in the field of entrepreneurship, democratising technologies, and corporate innovation. Drawn from his exec-experience in high profile tech companies and venture capital, we hear a casual and light hearted distillation of how to create unfair advantage in business; an ecosystem where the majority's status quo is to disrupt or compete with one another in isolation.  Shaveer Mirpuri is in the business of disruptive startups with the purpose of driving innovation. Upon his return to New Zealand, Shaveer formed GOAT Ventures which co-invests and co-creates companies with Fortune 500 corporates. He believes pairing radically opposite companies will create opportunities others could only dream of.\n\nHe’s been involved in hugely successful startups such as Wooga which grew to 300 staff and raised $24 million, he’s taken lead mentoring roles. He’s also personally consulted the CEO of Walmart on artificial intelligence strategy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on innovation.

It is the place between something stopping and something beginning, the hardest part is making the change stick. In this talk Nigel Parker shares a personal story of change where he creates a digital assistant that passively collects his health data and makes predictions when he is going off track. The assistant can predict when he is getting stressed or fighting a virus, and can give him a nudge at the right place and right time to adjust his behaviours. Nigel Parker is chief engineer for Microsoft Asia’s Commercial Software Engineering. His job is to seek out solutions to hard problems. But for him, it’s not just about the technology, it’s about the impact technology can have on people’s lives. In his own personal project, Nigel set about using technology to turn his health around and create better, stable habits.\n\nNigel believes as machine intelligence becomes more developed, humans must make sure they keep up and build symbiotic intelligence to expand human capability in ways that are both tangible and magical.

Instead, Chris Pemberton encourages you to focus on making the journey of life a colourful one and to create the mental space needed to open your mind to its infinite possibilities, as opposed to staying single-mindedly focus on one track. This way we can make sure all of the goals we are heading towards are in line with what drives us intrinsically. Chris believes the way to achieve this mindset is by exploring one's creativity. He shares his story of coming to this realisation, and the art projects he dived into that helped him discover the depths of his creative expression... and a psychedelic experience involving Ayahuasca. With an international experiment called Creative Mirror, Chris proves creativity exists in everyone, no matter their skill level. Chris is an electrician by trade, but his real passion lies in helping people lead more creative lives. As the founder of Humans of K Road and now Humans for the Future, Chris focuses on bring humans from all walks of life together to share sustainable ideas and pursue their creative endeavours. His exhibition Creative Mirror is currently touring the world, inspiring people to unleash their inner creativity, by connecting them to different artists and opening up the art world.\n\nChris also founded the Crisp Creative Club in Australia, which holds sessions to help others improve their creative mindset. As the author of The Creative Soul, Chris believes “If it's the journey, not the destination, then we may as well make the journey as creative and colourful as possible”.

Activist, Artist, Terrorist and Cyclist. Literally wearing his Tuhoe heritage on his face, Iti is hard to miss in a crowd despite being just 5ft 4\" tall. His 40 year history of controversial and theatrical displays of political expression have included pitching a tent on parliament grounds and calling it the Maori embassy, shooting a national flag in front of government officials and the curious spate of public meetings where he appeared with a ladder so as to speak eye to eye with officials who were seated on stage. Iti explores how the old saying of \"Te ka nohi ki te ka nohi\" (Dealing with it eye to eye) creates a far more productive space for open dialogue around any issue. \"No one can tell you that you are not important and your experience does not matter and if they do... I challenge them to say it to your face... where they can see your eyes and feel your breath.\"\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

At a deeper level, though, the MMQ's performance and talk challenges the way indigenous peoples are perceived in Western society and uses an ancient culture to build a bridge any audience can cross. \n\nThe suave crooners from the award-winning Modern Māori Quartet invite you to enjoy a fresh take on the classic Māori showbands of yesteryear.\r\n\r\nToi Whakaari: New Zealand Drama School alumni James Tito, Maaka Pohatu, Matariki Whatarau and Francis Kora bring the concept of a Māori Rat Pack into the present with a contemporary twist, weaving their acting and musical talents together to fuse hearty and humorous Māori storytelling with the glorious tradition of showband entertainment.\r\n\r\nModern Māori Quartet blends old school charm with modern pizzazz to highlight Aotearoa New Zealand’s musical past and present, featuring unique spins on Māori waiata (song), showband hits and pop music, all infused with the multi-talented Māori foursome’s irresistible charisma, sublime harmonies and universal humour.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

He completed his clinical training in Ireland before he crossed over to New Zealand where he initially worked as a registrar in neurosurgery and general surgery before he stepped into the world of eye. His main interests are eye regenerative medicine, bioengineering and telemedicine. His exposure to third world medicine in Kenya, Nepal and Malaysia have given him the insight to the burden of preventable blindness. He believes the problem lies in the access to quality eye care. In 2014, he founded OphthalmicDocs, an R&D company that focuses on the development of ultra mobile and economical eye tests and diagnostics devices. He has invented several eye imaging adapters that can be used in conjunction with a mobile application to diagnose and monitor eye diseases. Fighting preventable blindness is his career's primary mission.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
