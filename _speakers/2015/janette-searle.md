  Janette Searle had a life changing conversation that turned into ‘Take My
  Hands’ a not-for- profit organisation that redistributes prosthetic, orthotic
  and medical equipment to those in need. Every day, freight carriers and
  warehouses are often only partly full, so, Janette asked, what if we take
  advantage of that spare capacity and send vital equipment to those that need
  it? So far, the organisation has sent 50 boxes of artificial limbs, over 35
  boxes of medical equipment and used just a fraction of the spare capacity that
  exists in the industry. So what might happen if we started a global economy of
  spare capacity? Janette believes there is power in the collective when its
  collaboration is focused, and that it is people that make the world go round,
  not money.
