  Riley Elliott is a PhD candidate at the University of Auckland. With an
  Honours degree in Zoology and Masters with distinction in Marine Science from
  Otago University, Riley ventured to South Africa to find his true passion -
  sharks. Being a surfer, free diver and spear-fisherman, Riley wanted to
  understand why sharks instilled so much fear in people and whether it was
  warranted. What he found was far worse – sharks are in rapid decline,
  receiving little sympathy due to their demonised stereotype.


  Through the combination of high-tech science and stimulating visual imagery,
  Riley explains how conventional scientific communication can move at the speed
  of modern day media to achieve conservational goals. Riley is now utilising
  this form of communication to address international issues as the presenter of
  Shark Man TV.
