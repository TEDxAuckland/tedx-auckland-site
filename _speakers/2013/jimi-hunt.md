  Jimi Hunt is founder of the depression charity Live More Awesome, author of A
  Bit Mental and the only person silly enough to lilo the Waikato River. A
  sufferer of depression, Jimi aims to inspire people by doing the ridiculous –
  like building the world’s biggest waterslide – using these initiatives to help
  others with depression and raise awareness of New Zealand’s massive problem of
  depression, all while keeping himself sane.
