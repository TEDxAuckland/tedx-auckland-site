:description: "Gavin's talks about media and the current continuing environmental
  degradation our impact has on the planet while explaining his solution for making
  media a force for good and not continuing on the same path.\r\n\r\nGavin is originally
  from Ireland and from a very young age has been researching Celtic spirituality,
  behavioural change psychology and the medias influence on society.\r\n\r\nHis talk
  weaves the impact of growing up in country devastated by centuries of civil war,
  and how the 5,500 year old spiritual sites that surrounded his childhood home gave
  him hope, while leading him to his current profession and mission in life.\n\nGavin

  of a marketing for social good publishing company Viridian Media. Viridian co-founded
  Element magazine, which is the largest sustainability magazine in NZ. It gained
  global accolades within the media industry as it was crowned Best New Product at
  the International News Media Marketing Awards. “The whole idea of Element was to
  craft engaging media for positive social behavioural change”. Gavin is originally
  from Ireland and from a very young age has been researching Celtic spirituality,
  behavioural change psychology and the medias influence on society.\n\nThis talk
