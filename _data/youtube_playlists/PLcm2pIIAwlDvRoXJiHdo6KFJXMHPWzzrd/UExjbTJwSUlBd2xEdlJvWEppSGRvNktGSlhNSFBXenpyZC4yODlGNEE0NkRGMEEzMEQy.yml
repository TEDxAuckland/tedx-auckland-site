:item_title: 'Young Ocean Explorers: Using kids to connect with kids | Riley & Steve
  Hathaway | TEDxAuckland'
:description: |-
  When Steve put his daughter Riley as the front person for the show, his idea started to take off. Riley was a far better communicator to other children than an adult presenter.

  Riley Hathaway is a passionate 14-year-old ocean ambassador, who is already presenting her own TV series called ‘Young Ocean Explorers’. In Young Ocean Explorers, Steve and his daughter Riley present a captivating series of stories about what happens when a teenager comes face to face with the marine animals we’re all curious about, such as stingrays, orca, and turtles. It’s a winning combination: Riley’s got the questions and the teenage-cred, and Steve’s got the boat and underwater know-how. Together, they take us on a journey that has never been previously imagined: a fun, accessible glimpse into the world of New Zealand’s incredible underwater species.

  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx
