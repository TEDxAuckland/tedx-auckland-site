:item_title: 'The Hip Op-eration Crew: The world’s oldest dance troupe | Billie Jordan
  | TEDxAuckland'
:description: |-
  Watch the Hip Op-eration Crew performance 'D Floor Damager' here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsJjOxGhAE0 Billie formed the Hip Op-eration Crew as a flash mob initially in response to society's outcasting of elderly people. What grew from there was an amazing dance group and community that is centred around the idea of having big goals and  adventure later on in life. The Hip Op-eration Crew are officially the worlds oldest dance troupe listed by the Guinness World Records. http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/111063-oldest-dance-troupe

  After narrowly surviving New Zealand’s deadliest earthquake in Christchurch in 2011, Billie Jordan felt there was more to life than working as a communications consultant for large corporations. So she quit her job and moved to a small island off the East Coast of Auckland in New Zealand. Once there she taught herself how to dance following hip hop clips on YouTube, then gathered up her elderly neighbours (aged 68 to 96 years old) and established them as a hip hop dance crew with the audacious goal of performing at the World Hip hop Championships in Las Vegas within eight months. From that point on her life and the lives of her dance group changed forever.

  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx
