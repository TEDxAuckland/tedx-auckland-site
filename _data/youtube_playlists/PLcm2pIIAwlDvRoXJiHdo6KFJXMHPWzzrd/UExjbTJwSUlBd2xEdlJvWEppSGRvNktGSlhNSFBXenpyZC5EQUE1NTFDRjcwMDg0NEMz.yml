  The Hip Op-eration Crew dance performance at TEDxAuckland 2015. Watch Billie Jordan's talk on why the Hip Op-eration Crew formed here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saRWpSqQpPA

  The Hip Op-eration Crew started as a flash mob initially in response to society's outcasting of elderly people. What grew from there was an amazing dance group and community that is centred around the idea of having big goals and  adventure later on in life. The Hip Op-eration Crew are officially the worlds oldest dance troupe listed by the Guinness World Records. http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/111063-oldest-dance-troupe

  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx
