:item_title: 'Carbon-neutral in our lifetimes: Isabella Lenihan-Ikin at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  Western Springs College student Isabella Lenihan-Ikin has a vision for the future that sees reduced carbon emissions and recognition for young people as change makers in society. And she's working hard to make it happen. At school Isabella has worked with others to reduce waste to landfill by 50%, she's a member of youth climate change organisation Generation Zero and one of the founders of S.E.A.L Socially Environmentally Active Leaders. In 2012 she took part in the once-in-a-lifetime journey to the Kermadec Islands after being selected as a student voyager by the Sir Peter Blake Trust and she is currently serving as a youth MP.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
