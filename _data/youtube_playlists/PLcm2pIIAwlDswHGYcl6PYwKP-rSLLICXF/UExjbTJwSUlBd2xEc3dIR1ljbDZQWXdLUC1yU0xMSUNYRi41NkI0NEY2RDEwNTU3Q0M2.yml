:item_title: 'Cultural Chameleon from Africa to New Zealand: Brian Gashema at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  Brian Haley Gashema is a 17 year old Kenyan/Burundian student attending Northcote College. The second oldest of five kids, he was mothered by Hip Hop and adopted by Poetry. He is blessed by circumstances, choices and family. He fell in love and got into a serious relationship at a very early age with basketball but due to the wrong stars aligning and weak ligaments he traded the orange ball for a ball point pen which he hopes to use one day when carving his initials and thoughts into the world. Part of Grace Taylor's Rising Voices Youth Poetry Movement, Brian recently shared his work "I am Me" at the TEDxAuckland 2013 event and received a standing ovation from the 2,000+ audience.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
