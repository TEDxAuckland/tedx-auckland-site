:item_title: 'From takers to makers, turning kids into coders: Christian Silver at
  TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  Christian Silver is on a mission to make programming more accessible to youth. He has already developed games, websites and has an app running on mobile. While his intermediate school years introduced him to a love of mathematics, science, technology and more specifically computer programming, the demands of education have often seemed to push him away from his talents in the digital media space. To counter this negative push -- something he sees being caused by both too little engagement with ICT education and a consumerist attitude to the technology we use -- Christian is in the process of creating a system, Decode, where young people can easily learn to program.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
