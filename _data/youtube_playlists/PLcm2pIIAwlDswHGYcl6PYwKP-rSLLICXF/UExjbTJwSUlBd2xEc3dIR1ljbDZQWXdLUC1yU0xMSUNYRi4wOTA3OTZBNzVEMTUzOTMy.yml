:item_title: 'Breaking into film, one fluffy sock at a time: Elspeth Carroll at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  At 16 Elspeth Carroll has a growing list of film credits for acting, direction and production of fiction short film, documentary and an ad for the Fair Go ad awards. In 2011 she decided to make her love of film into something tangible and created her own film company Fluffy Socks Films (named due to a fondness for the comforting item of clothing). Among her film credits are Phasma Phamatis, which won a stack of awards in the Youthtown NZ Short Film Challenge 2011 including Best Film Runner Up, and An Education which saw Elspeth win the Best Documentary award for Year 9-13 in Auckland Museum's Making Movies competition. So far her love of film has already taken her to New York and her longer term plan is to become a producer but for now she's gaining experience across all the aspects of filmmaking.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
