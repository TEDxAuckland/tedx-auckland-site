:item_title: 'Quest is fun, be nosey: Tristan Pang at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  A genuine love of learning and the ability to focus are two of the characteristics that have seen 12-year-old Tristan Pang achieve so much in such a short time. Year Seven at Ficino School, Tristan teaches himself at home and has been sitting Cambridge International Exams since he was nine and earning top grades. He will be a University Maths student by 2014. He is a cadet of St John, squad member of the swimming club, member of Mensa, member of the New Zealand Association for Gifted Children and a piano player. He enjoys all science subjects, literature and philosophy. Tristan believes the key to excelling is to: think big, plan ahead, get organised and go for it.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
