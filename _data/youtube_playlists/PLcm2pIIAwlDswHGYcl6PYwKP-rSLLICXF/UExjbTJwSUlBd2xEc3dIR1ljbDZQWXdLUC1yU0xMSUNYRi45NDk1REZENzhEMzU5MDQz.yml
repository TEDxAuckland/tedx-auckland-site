:item_title: 'Youngest solo sailor, around the world at 16: Laura Dekker at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  At 16 years old Laura Dekker became the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the globe single-handedly. During her 518-day voyage Laura took on six-metre-high waves, extreme weather, dangerous reefs, disturbed sleep, cramped living conditions, food rationing and absolute solitude. She also kept up with her schoolwork.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
