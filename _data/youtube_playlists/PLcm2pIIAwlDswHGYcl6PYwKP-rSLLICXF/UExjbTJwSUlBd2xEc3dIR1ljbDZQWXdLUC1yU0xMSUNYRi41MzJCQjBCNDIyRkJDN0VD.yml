:item_title: 'The sweet sound of science, music and yeast: Ella Buchanan at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  Slime mould and yeast aren't necessarily the average interests of an intermediate student but listening to Ella Buchanan, perhaps they should be. She credits having a dad who is a scientist for helping to spark her own fascination with science and now, at 12 years old, she has a growing stack of awards recognising her own scientific research. In primary school her first project saw her replicating how Alexander Fleming had inadvertently created penicillin. Last year Ella entered the Niwa Auckland Science Fair with her project 'Slime Mould, My New Pet' and gained first place and the award for Excellence in Biological Science. This year her project 'Yeasts Feast on Sugar and Sound' won first place in the Material Worlds category, the award for Original Research Years, and the Premier Gold Award for Best Project for Years 7-13. Currently Head Girl at Auckland Normal Intermediate, Ella is motivated by her love of the intrigue and processes in science, and sharing new discoveries with others.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
