:item_title: 'Saving Sharks, putting a finish to finning: Taylor Finderup at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  A keen surfer and certified beach lover, 14-year-old Taylor Finderup loves the ocean and is taking real steps to protect it and the animals that call it home. On a day-to-day level, Taylor uses her spare time to go down to the beach and collect rubbish that could end up choking marine animals or birds. Not satisfied with just taking action in her own life though, her love of sharks has seen Taylor start her own 'Stop the Finning' campaign to bring an end to shark finning - a practice still legal in New Zealand. Taylor has developed her own website educating people about shark finning and how they can do their bit to stop it.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
