:item_title: 'Travelling on trash, 100kms on a Plastic Bottle Kayak: Shruthi Vijayakumar
  at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  Shruthi Vijayakumar's journey into youth activism and entrepreneurship began with a trip to Cambodia in 2009 as a World Vision Youth Ambassador, visiting development projects and communicating what she'd learned to her peers back home. In 2010 she became involved with the youth-for-youth charity P3 Foundation, taking on the role of CEO in 2011 and growing P3 from 20 volunteers to a national organization with over 100 volunteers. In 2012 she was selected as a Young Explorer for the Mike Horn Pangaea Project enabling her to explore the Swiss Alps and the Amazon Rainforest on an environmental expedition. She co-organised The Plastic Bottle Kayak Expedition which saw 25 young people from all over New Zealand kayaking the Whanganui River in kayaks made of plastic bottles to raise awareness of the need for ethical consumerism. A semi-finalist for the Young New Zealander of the Year Award, Shruthi recently completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Auckland and now works for the Boston Consulting Group.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
