:item_title: 'Digging into robotics, building a low-budget lifesaver: Vandan Patel
  at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  Student by day. Developer by night. Vandan Patel is making plans to solve the world's need for cheap technology. Right now he is a 15-year-old software engineer making solutions for start-ups and creating robots in his living room. He can use the programming languages C# and Java and he's on the verge of creating his own company. Central to what he wants to achieve with his talents in technology is his belief in the community-minded principles of volunteer organisation BAPS NZ. Part of a worldwide network the ethos of BAPS is to care for the world by caring for its societies, families and individuals and its members donate hours of their time to serve others. Other ambitions: to become New Zealand's best innovator.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
