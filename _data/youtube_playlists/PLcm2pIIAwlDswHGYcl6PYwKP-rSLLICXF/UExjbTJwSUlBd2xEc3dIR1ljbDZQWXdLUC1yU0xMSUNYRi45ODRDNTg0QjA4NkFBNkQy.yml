:item_title: 'Striking a chord with the world''s biggest Piano: Adrian Mann at TEDxYouth@Auckland'
:description: |-
  Working with a large allen key and a 12mm socket, Adrian Mann tuned his first piano age 12 years old. The tuning was self-taught and it was a sign of much bigger things to come. At age 15 the talented pianist carried out an experiment with a very long piece of piano wire to see what sort of sounds he could achieve and just how far he could take it. Adrian went on to build the world's longest piano - the Alexander Piano, which he named after his great, great grandfather Alexander Barrie Mann. The 5.7m piano has since spent time in the Otago Museum and been used for multiple local concerts.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
