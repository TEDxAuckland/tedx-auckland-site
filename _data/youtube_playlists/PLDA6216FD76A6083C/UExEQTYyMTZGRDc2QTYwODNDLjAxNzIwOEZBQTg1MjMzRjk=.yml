  TEDxAuckland 2009, Nigel Parker, Failure Is The Best Possible Outcome.

  Nigel is a technologist. Just as importantly, he is unafraid of failure - having seen it first hand in the dot-com bubble. Now working with Microsoft, he develops some of the most useful and exciting technologies around. His unusual advice is to 'fail fast' and drive innovation forward.

  About TEDx, x = independently organized event
  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
