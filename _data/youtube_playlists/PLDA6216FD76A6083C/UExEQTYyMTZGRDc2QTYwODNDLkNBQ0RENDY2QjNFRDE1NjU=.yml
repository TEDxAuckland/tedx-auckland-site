  TEDx, x = independently organized event \L\LIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
