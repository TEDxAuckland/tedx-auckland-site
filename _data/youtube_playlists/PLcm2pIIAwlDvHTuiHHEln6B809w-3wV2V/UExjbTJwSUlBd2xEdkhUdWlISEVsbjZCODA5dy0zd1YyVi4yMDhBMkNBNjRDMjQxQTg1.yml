  Baragwanath | TEDxAuckland'
:description: "When you look at the world through disabilities, you look at he world
  through opportunities that haven't been taken yet. Minnie breaks this down to an
  amazing world that we all live in of untapped opportunity of accessibility opportunity
  that makes us all better.\n\nMinnie is CEO and co-founder of Be. Accessible, a social
  change agency that is shifting how Kiwis value accessibility and the contribution
  to our world by people with access needs. This vibrant and innovative approach to
  social change has caught the attention of government, business, entrepreneurs and
  communities throughout New Zealand and the world. At itâ€™s heart Be. Accessible is
  moving the emphasis from a notion of disability to Poss-ability, from deficit to
  strength, from disempowerment to leadership! Values of creativity, positivity, flexibility
  and generosity are at the heart of this social movement and underpin the work of
  Be.\r\n\r\nMinnie was a recipient of the Sir Peter Blake Leadership award 2013 and
  was made a Member of the NZ Order of Merit Queens Honour in 2014.\n\nThis talk was
  given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized
  by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
