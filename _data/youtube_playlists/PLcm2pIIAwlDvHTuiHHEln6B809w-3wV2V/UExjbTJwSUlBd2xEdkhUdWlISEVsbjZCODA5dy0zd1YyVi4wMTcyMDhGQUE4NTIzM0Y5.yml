  divided nation from the brink of bloodshed to unexpected levels of peace and stability.\r\n\r\nHear
  Rory's story about the small things that made Nelson Mandela great.\n\nAfter rising
  through the ranks of the South African police force, Rory was appointed to the Presidential
  Protection Unit in 1996, and was made team leader of President Nelson Mandelaâ€™s
  personal security detail, handling the protection of the former President both nationally
  and internationally.\r\n\r\nRory watched Mandela, up close and personal, as he led
  the racially divided nation from the brink of bloodshed to unexpected levels of
  peace and stability.\r\n\r\nWhat Rory learnt from the man, once seen as a terrorist
  by South African authorities, changed his life forever.\n\nThis talk was given at
  a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local
  community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
