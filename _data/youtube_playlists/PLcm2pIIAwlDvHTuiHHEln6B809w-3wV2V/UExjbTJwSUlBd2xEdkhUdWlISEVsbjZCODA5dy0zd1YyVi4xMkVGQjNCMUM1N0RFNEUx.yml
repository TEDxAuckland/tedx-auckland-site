:item_title: Release Me | Anna Coddington | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Anna Coddington's new single ‘Release Me’. The yacht-rock inspired
  ‘Release Me’ features a driving rhythm sitting alongside a riff which lures in the
  listener. Performed live for the first time with Fly My Pretties early in 2016,
  ‘Release Me’ is another welcome addition to the catalogue of Anna.\r\nhttp://www.annacoddington.com/\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AnnaCoddingtonMusic\n\nAnna
  is one of NZ’s finest musicians known for her enchanting live performances and a
  voice which “flows perfectly from soft to grunty”.\r\n\r\nAnna is currently working
  on her third album which will be the culmination of five years of diligent songwriting
  and many hours in her home studio, combined with studio sessions at Auckland’s The
  Lab with some of NZ’s finest musicians.\r\n\r\nShe holds a Master’s Degree in Linguistics,
  is a former winner of the Smokefree Rockquest as a teen, and has been a finalist
  for the Silver Scroll numerous times. Anna is a frequent collaborator with the collective
  Fly My Pretties, a mother, environmentalist, and a second-dan Karate black belt.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
