:item_title: Finding your inner weirdo | Vaughan Rowsell | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Vaughan's idea is that society now in the modern world needs more weirdos
  and outliers to explore beyond the cultural norms.\n\nVaughan is the Founder of
  Vend, a cloud based retail software for small to medium retailers worldwide. The
  Vend team hold three core values dearly in their hearts; to delight retailers, to
  do the impossible, and to take care of one another.\r\n\r\nVaughan also co-founded
  OMG Tech! an initiative to encourage kids of all backgrounds, genders, and ages
  to get into technology. It not only covers coding, but all newly developed technology
  such as robots, drones, nanotech, teleportation and hover-boards. They give kids
  the chance to explore and get inspired by technology that they will be experts in
  ten years from now.\r\n\r\nHe dreams big and likes to set himself impossible challenges;
  whether it is cycling the length of New Zealand solo, running 1,000 kilometres,
  or building a $100M venture.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED
  conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at
