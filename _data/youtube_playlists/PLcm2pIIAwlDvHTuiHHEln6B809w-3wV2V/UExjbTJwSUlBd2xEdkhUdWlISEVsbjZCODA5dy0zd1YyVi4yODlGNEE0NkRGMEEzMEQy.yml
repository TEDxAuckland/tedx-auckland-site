:item_title: 'My body my terms: a new conversation about sex | Lizzie Marvelly | TEDxAuckland'
:description: "Lizzie's campaign #MyBodyMyTerms was aimed to spark conversation about
  victim-blaming, revenge porn, consent and sexual violence.\r\n\r\nHer talk is on
  the follow up from #MyBodyMyTerms and how we need to update the conservation on
  sex in modern society.\n\nWhile Lizzie Marvelly traverses many diverse paths, her
  journey started with her love for music. Discovered by Frankie Stevens and her famous
  uncle, Sir Howard Morrison, in her early teens, Lizzie was on the road at age 16
  – since then her musical life has been a wild ride.\r\n\r\nIn May 2015, Lizzie launched
  Villainesse.com, an online media project aiming to create smart, ‘no-filter’ media
  for young women. Villainesse is on a mission to empower young women and to hear
  more young female voices represented in the media.\r\n\r\nLater that year, Lizzie
  launched Villainesse’s first major campaign, the globally-successful #MyBodyMyTerms.
  The #MyBodyMyTerms videos have been viewed over 450,000 times and aimed to spark
  conversation about victim-blaming, revenge porn, consent and sexual violence.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
