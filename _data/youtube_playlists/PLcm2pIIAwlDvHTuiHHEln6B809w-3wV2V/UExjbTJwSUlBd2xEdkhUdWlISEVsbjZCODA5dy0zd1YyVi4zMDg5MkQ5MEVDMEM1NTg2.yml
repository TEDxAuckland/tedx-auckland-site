:item_title: Reaching out to mental wellness | Matt Shirtcliffe | TEDxAuckland
:description: "After Matt's wife Mary died of depression a year ago, Matt reflected
  on what he could take out of it to help others. The result was a programme that
  encourages people across the farming community to reach out to both ask for and
  offer help when they need it.\n\nFather of two teens, awarded advertising creative
  director, ad agency owner, mountain runner, farm owner, poet, Christian. Matt was
  living a full and rewarding life last year when it profoundly changed last year.
  His wife of 17 years Mary, a farmer, died of depression.\r\n\r\nSearching for something
  good to come from his grief, Matt used his own experiences to speak out about mental
  health in the rural community. He wasnâ€™t prepared for the impact it would have or
  the enormity of the response. The journey since has reframed his own life in positive
  ways.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but
  independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
