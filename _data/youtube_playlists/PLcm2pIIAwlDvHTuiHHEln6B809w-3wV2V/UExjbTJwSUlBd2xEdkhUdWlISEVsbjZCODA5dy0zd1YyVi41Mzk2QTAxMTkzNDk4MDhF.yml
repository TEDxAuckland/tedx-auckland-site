:item_title: Digital Me and the rise of precision medicine | Ian McCrae | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Our bodies contain two terabytes of data. What if everyone involved
  in our healthcare – including us – could access that data and use it to make better
  lifestyle and treatment decisions? Precision medicine aims to answer that question
  and turn information into better health outcomes for everyone.\n\nIan began his
  professional career employed as a scientist writing mathematical models of the human
  body, before moving into the commercial world. In 1993 he founded Orion Health with
  a team of just four people and has grown the company to over 1,250 staff in 27 offices
  worldwide, enabling healthcare to more than 90 million patients worldwide.\r\n\r\nIan
  is passionate about the role that technology can play in enabling highly personalised
  care for individuals through the practice of precision medicine – using personal
  healthcare information that is captured and made available in real time. This technology
  will transform the practice of medicine into a mathematical science, and for a lapsed
  mathematician like Ian that means the health sector just got a whole lot more interesting.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
