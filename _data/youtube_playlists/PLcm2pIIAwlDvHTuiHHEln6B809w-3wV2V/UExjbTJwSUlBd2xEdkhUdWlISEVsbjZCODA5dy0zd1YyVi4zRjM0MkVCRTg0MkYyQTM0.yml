:item_title: Cultural capital for corporates | Michael Moka | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Michael's talk focuses on a cultural and people approach to solving
  two issues.\r\n1. The pressure on Senior Management to produce results and profit.\r\n2.
  Conquering the Poverty Cycle for those on the front line who want to get out.\n\nMichael
  is the founder of Indigenous Growth – a new organisation with a quadruple bottom
  line – which feeds his passion to empower families like his to get themselves out
  of the poverty cycle.\r\n\r\nSince 2005 he chose a specialised path dedicated to
  this goal of serving his family and families like his. Indigenous Growth takes a
  culturally diverse approach, building their people from the grassroots level to
  provide a more diverse and profitable culture for all organisations.\r\n\r\nMike
  holds a number of governance and advisory roles for Whanau Organisations, Charities,
  Learning Institutions and Not for Profit organisations.\n\nThis talk was given at
  a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local
  community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
