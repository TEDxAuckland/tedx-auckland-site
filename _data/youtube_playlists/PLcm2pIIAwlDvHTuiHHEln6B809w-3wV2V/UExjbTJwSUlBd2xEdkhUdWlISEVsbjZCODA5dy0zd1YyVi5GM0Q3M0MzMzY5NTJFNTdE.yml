:item_title: Building business from by-products | Adrien Taylor | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Adrien Taylor thought it was ridiculous that so many perfectly good
  off-cuts from fabric were thrown out to landfill, so he got his best mate Matt Purcell
  involved to launch their range of super limited caps made from off-cuts.\r\n\r\nAdrien's
  idea is about looking wider to other industries and creating great things from the
  by-products or by-waste in those areas that produce waste.\n\nAdrien is the former
  environment reporter for 3News (now Newshub). He left his full-time position in
  Auckland last year to pursue the startup dream.\r\n\r\nSince then, he’s been to
  Bangladesh to film a climate change documentary for the United Nations and has gone
  on to found two companies: furniture procurement website Bamtino and cap company
  Offcut.\r\n\r\nAdrien came up with the idea for Offcut on a visit to his father’s
  textile warehouse in Christchurch. He thought it was ridiculous that so many perfectly
  good off-cuts were thrown out to landfill, so he got his best mate Matt Purcell
  involved to launch their range of super limited five panel caps. All Offcut caps
  are handcrafted in New Zealand and a tree is planted with every cap sold.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
