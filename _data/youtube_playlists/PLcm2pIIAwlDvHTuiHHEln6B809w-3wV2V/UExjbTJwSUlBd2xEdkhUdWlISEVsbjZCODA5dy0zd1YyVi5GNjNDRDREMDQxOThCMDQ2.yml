:item_title: Giving stereotypes the slip | Jess Holly Bates | TEDxAuckland
:description: "We all have personas, masks, different people we are when are around
  different groups. Jess breaks this wide open with a unique talk/performance about
  how we can slip between different projections of ourselves. See her new project
  on Boosted here http://www.boosted.org.nz/projects/the-offensive-nipple-show-road-to-melbourne\n\nJess
  is a theatre practitioner, vulnerability junkie, writer and artist, who loves to
  communicate cultural criticism through performance.\r\n\r\nShe investigates the
  way our bodies behave in social relations, particularly in relation to our ongoing
  colonial hangover in New Zealand. In 2014 her acclaimed solo theatre show Real Fake
  White Dirt, (Best Writing NZ Fringe 2015) was published as a book of poetry by Anahera
  Press.\r\n\r\nShe believes that the only way to acknowledge our difficult history
  is to lean into the real discomfort of being Pakeha. Her 2016 work The Offensive
  Nipple Show is a collaborative body project responding to the dangerous ways gender
  politics are disconnecting us from one another. Through performance, she seeks to
  find new ways of looking at each others bodies, that are both cheeky and empowering.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
