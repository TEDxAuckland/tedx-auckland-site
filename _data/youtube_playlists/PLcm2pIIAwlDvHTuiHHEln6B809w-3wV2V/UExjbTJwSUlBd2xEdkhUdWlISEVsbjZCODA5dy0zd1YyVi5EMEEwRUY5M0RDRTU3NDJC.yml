:item_title: Batman journalism and the pitfalls of total independence | Keith Ng |
  TEDxAuckland
:description: "There are many advantages and disadvantages by being an independent
  journalist. Keith's talk blows them away and the media industry itself by showcasing
  the pros and cons of it.\n\nAs a young man, Keith dreamed of being a hobo-journalist
  – seeing the world and telling stories while living out of a sack. But what started
  out as a naive warzone adventure turned into lifelong vendetta and alternative funding
  model for independent journalism.\r\n\r\nIt has been almost a decade, and these
  days Keith does data visualisation consulting to fund his journalism projects, with
  the thought of sustainable crowdfunding just over the horizon. The independence
  from self-funding (“Batman journalism!”) creates a wonderful and dangerous space
  for innovation, disruption, getting lost and going crazy. If he’s lucky, one day,
  it might even allow him to live out of a sack.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx
  event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
