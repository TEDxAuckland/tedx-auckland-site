:item_title: Saying goodbye to binary gender | Pani Farvid | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Pani talks about how the dominant heterosexual societal way of our
  culture has many downsides and proposes using more masculine and feminine ways of
  describing characteristics and not people could have benefits for all.\n\nPani is
  a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Auckland University of Technology. For over a
  decade, Pani has researched the intersection of gender, power, culture, sexuality
  and identity â€“ largely focusing on how heterosexuality plays out in domains such
  as casual sex, online dating, mass media and the New Zealand sex industry. She is
  currently focusing on examining mobile dating, in order to explore how such technology
  is (re)shaping intimate relations in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nHer work seeks to
  dismantle the rigid gender binaries associated with heterosexuality. She is a regular
  media commentator on issues related to gender, sexuality, gender equality and sexism.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
