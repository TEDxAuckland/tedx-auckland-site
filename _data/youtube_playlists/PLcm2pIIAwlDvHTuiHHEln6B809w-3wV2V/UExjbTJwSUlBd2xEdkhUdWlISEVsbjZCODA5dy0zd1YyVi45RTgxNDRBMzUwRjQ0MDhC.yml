:item_title: 'Whānau: building a bridge from performer to audience | Modern Māori
  Quartet | TEDxAuckland'
:description: "One one level, the Modern Māori Quartet was formed to bring to the
  stage the easygoing vibe its founders remember from their parents' casual, guitar-fuelled
  garage parties of the 70s and 80s. At a deeper level, though, the MMQ's performance
  and talk challenges the way indigenous peoples are perceived in Western society
  and uses an ancient culture to build a bridge any audience can cross. \n\nThe suave
  crooners from the award-winning Modern Māori Quartet invite you to enjoy a fresh
  take on the classic Māori showbands of yesteryear.\r\n\r\nToi Whakaari: New Zealand
  Drama School alumni James Tito, Maaka Pohatu, Matariki Whatarau and Francis Kora
  bring the concept of a Māori Rat Pack into the present with a contemporary twist,
  weaving their acting and musical talents together to fuse hearty and humorous Māori
  storytelling with the glorious tradition of showband entertainment.\r\n\r\nModern
  Māori Quartet blends old school charm with modern pizzazz to highlight Aotearoa
  New Zealand’s musical past and present, featuring unique spins on Māori waiata (song),
  showband hits and pop music, all infused with the multi-talented Māori foursome’s
  irresistible charisma, sublime harmonies and universal humour.\n\nThis talk was
  given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized
  by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
