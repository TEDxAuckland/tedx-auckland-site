:item_title: 'Yes: the word that built an orphanage | Jayne Bailey | TEDxAuckland'
:description: "Jayne believes all of us are faced with plenty of amazing and sometimes
  scary opportunities; the trick is having the courage to say yes to them. Her first
  yes led to a series of others, resulting in a girls' orphanage 14,000 kilometres
  away from her New Zealand home.\n\nJayne has been described as many things; a brave
  adventurer, a visionary, an infectious truth-teller, a teacher, a mentor and an
  encourager.\r\n\r\nShe has experienced bible smuggling into China, overland trucking
  in Africa, micro lighting over Victoria Falls, bathing elephants in Nepal, hot air
  ballooning in Cappadocia, walking part of the Camino de Santiago, trekking in the
  Himalayas, and horse riding in Turkey, Argentina and the length of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn
  2011, Jayne started her new adventure, a charity called Project Moroto which provides
  safe dormitory living for orphaned girls in Moroto, Uganda. She has provided a haven
  for 20 gorgeous girls, but what Jayne is most passionate about is giving these girls
  a “go”- an opportunity to find and fulfil their potential.\n\nThis talk was given
  at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a
  local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
