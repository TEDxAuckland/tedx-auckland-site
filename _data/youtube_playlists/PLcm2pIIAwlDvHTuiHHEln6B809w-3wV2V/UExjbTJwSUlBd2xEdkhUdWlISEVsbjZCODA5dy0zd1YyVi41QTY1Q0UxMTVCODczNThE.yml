:item_title: Growth through lazy innovation | Georgia Lala | TEDxAuckland
:description: "As a 13 year old, Georgia Lala wanted to change the world – but says
  she was just too lazy. So she started a journey of lazy innovation: world changing
  ideas that can happen with minimal effort, sometimes right on your kitchen bench.\n\nGeorgia
  is trying to change the way we look at sustainability. Her award winning research
  into the applications of aquaponics won her the Prime Minister’s Future Scientist
  award, and at the age of 18 she started her own business, Root Aquaponics, where
  she hopes to start selling aquaponic units she designed to homes and schools in
  New Zealand.\r\n\r\nAn environmentalist at heart, Georgia has led sustainability
  expos to educate others on the importance of future proofing today’s industries,
  and has been invited as a guest speaker at community events. Georgia hopes to challenge
  the way individuals and companies look at adopting sustainable approaches to both
  production and living.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference
  format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
