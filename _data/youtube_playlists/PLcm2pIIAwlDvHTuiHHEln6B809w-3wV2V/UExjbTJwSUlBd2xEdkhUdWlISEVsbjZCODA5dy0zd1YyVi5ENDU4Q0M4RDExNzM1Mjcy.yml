:item_title: Teaching about money in a cashless society | James Bergin | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Money makes the world go around (maybe!) but many children today have
  never seen cash... instead watching as their parents pay for things electronically
  and invisibly. So how can parents make money tangible to their children? James's
  approach centres on a \"cashless moneybox,\" designed to make money seem real and
  help children understand the tangibility of money. \n\nJames is the Chief Architect
  at ASB bank and father of three young children.\r\n\r\nAs a father, James has a
  keen interest in financial literacy and the challenge of teaching new generations
  about money. He believes that as money becomes less tangible in our digital world,
  we need to find new ways of using technology to impart good money habits to our
  kids in order to increase their financial well-being.\r\n\r\nAt ASB James is helping
  the 168-year-old bank to rethink itself as a tech company, licensed and trusted
  to provide financial services.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the
  TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more
