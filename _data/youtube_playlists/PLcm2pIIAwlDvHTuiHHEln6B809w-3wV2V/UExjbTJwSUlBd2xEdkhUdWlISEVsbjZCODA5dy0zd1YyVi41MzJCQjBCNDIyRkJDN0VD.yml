:item_title: The Myth of Race | Sharad Paul | TEDxAuckland
:description: "Sharad argues that the modern perception of race is wrong and that
  science and the story of Vitamin D and Folic acid tell their own story about race
  and skin colour.\n\nDr. Sharad P. Paul is an academic specialising in skin cancer
  surgery, both in New Zealand and Australia. His Skin Surgery Clinic has one of the
  largest series of skin cancer patients worldwide, with over 100,000 consultations
  and 35,000 operations since the clinic was established in 1996.\r\n\r\nAward winning
  Sharad has served on the National Commission of UNESCO, and teaches creative writing
  to disadvantaged children by personally visiting schools once a week, and by funding
  school libraries. These initiatives are supported through the model of social entrepreneurship
  created by projects such as The Baci Lounge, an award-winning bookstore, within
  his own Baci Foundation.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference
  format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
