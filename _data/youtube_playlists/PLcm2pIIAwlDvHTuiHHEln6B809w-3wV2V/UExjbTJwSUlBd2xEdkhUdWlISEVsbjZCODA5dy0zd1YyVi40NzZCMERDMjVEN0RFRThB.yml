  | TEDxAuckland'
:description: "At 16, New Zealand high school student Toby  Carr had already moved
  on from his first business failure to found a nationwide company providing IT hardware
  to secondary schools and employing 17 people. Toby believes the lessons he's learnt
  along the way have prepared him far more thoroughly for a career in business than
  years in the classroom ever could have, and passionately believes in giving young
  people the opportunity to learn on the real world. \n\nToby is a entrepreneur and
  change maker at his core. Since starting his first registered company aged 14, Toby
  has been challenging and questioning the status quo for business and education.
  After founding and being a part of many startups, he believes strongly in choosing
  your own path of purpose.\r\n\r\nToby trades in the Computers and Technology space
  with DeXTech, providing innovative and modern solutions to a variety of customers,
  including the education sector. A frequent speaker on business and technology.\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
