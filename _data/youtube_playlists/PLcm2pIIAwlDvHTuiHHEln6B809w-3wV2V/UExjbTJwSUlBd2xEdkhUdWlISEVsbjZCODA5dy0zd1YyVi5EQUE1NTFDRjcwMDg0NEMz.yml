:item_title: Mapping by drone - Africa to Antartica | Barbara Breen | TEDxAuckland
:description: "While some drones are used to destroy, Barbara's team uses them – complete
  with military guidance technology – to map threatened ecosystems in Africa, Australia
  and Antarctica.\n\nBarbara is a senior lecturer in the School of Applied Sciences
  at Auckland University of Technology and has over 20 years’ experience working in
  government and NGO’s.\r\n\r\nHer research and personal interests are in geography,
  ecosystem management, cultural landscapes and spatial ecology. Her research focus
  has been the identification, selection and management of Protected Areas, using
  geospatial sciences and novel remote sensing technology, such as drones, to map
  habitats and landscapes for conservation planning.\r\n\r\nBarbara’s work has taken
  her to some of the world’s most remote and unique ecosystems including desert systems
  in both Antarctica and the Namibia. She is a self confessed techno-nerd and is an
  advocate for the effective use of drones for good in NZ and beyond.\n\nThis talk
  was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized
  by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
