:description: |-
  TEDxAuckland attendees were the first in the world to interact with Baby X - the brainchild of New Zealander Mark Sagar, the multi Academy Award winner (formerly Special Projects Supervisor at Weta Digital) and his Laboratory for Animate Technologies, has been working to develop artificial intelligence that creates its own expressions and emotions, and can think and react. BabyX is a co-production with Augusto (http://www.augusto.co.nz) and The Laboratory of Animate Technologies (http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/projects/animate-technologies.html).
