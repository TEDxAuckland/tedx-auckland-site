:description: |-
  Ash Graham with Petra Bullock.

  Ash didn't choose music, it chose him, and lucky for us it did. His songs show a maturity that is quite beyond his 18 years. His new EP Sixth Street Soul will be released in July this year shows a new and developed progression in his music, and has seen him working with the likes of Andrew Spraggon (Sola Rosa). He has already won a myriad of competitions, supported a wide range of artists from I am Giant to Anna Coddington to Shihad. His songs have placed in song writing competitions nationally and internationally, and he's playing the big NZ festivals (R n V, Blues & Brews). His music has a hook that keeps you wanting to come back for more.

  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
