:description: "Dead babies and brutal fuckin honesty is a blog Jimi wrote and what
  happened after that he explains here.\n\nJimi Hunt is founder of the depression
  charity Live More Awesome, author of A Bit Mental and the only person silly enough
  to lilo the Waikato River. A sufferer of depression, Jimi aims to inspire people
  by doing the ridiculous -- like building the world's biggest waterslide -- using
  these initiatives to help others with depression and raise awareness of New Zealand's
  massive problem of depression, all while keeping himself sane.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jimihunt.com\r\nhttp://livemoreawesome.com\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com\n\nThis
  talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
