:item_title: Taking science primetime | Riley Elliott | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. Riley combines scientific research with media savvy to take
  his ideas to a mass audience. His talk describes how he balances the two sometimes
  opposing worlds of media and science.\n\nRiley Elliott is a PhD candidate at the
  University of Auckland. With an Honours degree in Zoology and Masters with distinction
  in Marine Science from Otago University, Riley ventured to South Africa to find
  his true passion - sharks. Being a surfer, free diver and spear-fisherman, Riley
  wanted to understand why sharks instilled so much fear in people and whether it
  was warranted. What he found was far worse â€“ sharks are in rapid decline, receiving
  little sympathy due to their demonised stereotype.\r\n\r\nThrough the combination
  of high-tech science and stimulating visual imagery, Riley explains how conventional
  scientific communication can move at the speed of modern day media to achieve conservational
  goals. Riley is now utilising this form of communication to address international
  issues as the presenter of Shark Man TV.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized
  event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized
  events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event,
  TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection
  in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
  independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance
  for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject
  to certain rules and regulations)"
