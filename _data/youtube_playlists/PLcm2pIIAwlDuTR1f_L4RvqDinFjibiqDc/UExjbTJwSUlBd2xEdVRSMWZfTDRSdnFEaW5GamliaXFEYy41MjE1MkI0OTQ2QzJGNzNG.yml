:item_title: Small steps to the top of the world | Mike Allsop | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. Mike crash landed a commercial place in the pacific ocean,
  after that he re thought about his life and became an adventurer. Climbing Mt Everest,
  running 7 marathons in 7 continents in 7 days, Mike gives is story and his idea
  on how he achieves these goals and lives his life.\n\nAir New Zealand pilot, Everest
  mountaineer, adventurer and extreme marathon competitor, Mike is an ordinary family
  man proving that anybody can accomplish extraordinary things.\r\n\r\nLife took a
  dramatic turn when a flight from the USA to New Zealand led to a crash-landing into
  the sea off the coast of Hawaii in the dark of night. The US Coast Guard colonel
  who eventually rescued Mike and his crew commented that nobody else had ever survived
  a crash landing into that part of the ocean.\r\n\r\nAs well as becoming an Air New
  Zealand captain, Mike harboured another ambition – to stand at the top of Everest
  and, true to form, he conquered this goal in an unguided expedition. He has since
  gone on to conquer numerous other mountains, narrowly dodged a fatal avalanche in
  Peru, risked being shot in Russia, and returned a replica of a stolen Yeti hand
  to a monastery in Nepal. He’s also one of a handful of athletes who have ever run
  7 marathons in 7 days on 7 continents.\r\n\r\nMost recently, Mike returned to the
  Himalayas to run the world’s highest marathon around Everest. This was a feat never
  before attempted and a milestone that was captured in the documentary film Chasing
  Altitude showing that others too can achieve their dreams and ambitions by overcoming
  the fear of failure and breaking each goal into a series of smaller steps.\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
