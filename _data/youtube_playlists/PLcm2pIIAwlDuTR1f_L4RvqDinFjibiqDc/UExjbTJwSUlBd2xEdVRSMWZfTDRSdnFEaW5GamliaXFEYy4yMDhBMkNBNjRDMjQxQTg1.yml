:item_title: Transmedia and the future of storytelling | Dave Boivin | TEDxAuckland
:description: |-
  Dave Boivin is a Transmedia Consultant and the founder of Deep Immersion, a New Zealand Transmedia solutions company. Cinema is Dave’s first love, a passion borne out of his days working long shifts at an Auckland multiplex. It was here that Dave observed first hand the powerful build-up and after-effect of the cinematic experience; he could see viewers searching for an opportunity to engage with the material before and after the screening.

  Long before Transmedia was a word, Dave began developing small stunt-based ‘happenings’ staged within the cinema complex that served to ‘compliment’ or ‘complicate’ the viewers experience of the film. And now – to cut a long story short – it’s what he does for a living.

  Deep Immersion helps creative producers and artists find exciting ways to give their stories life beyond the page, the stage, and the screen. Dave is constantly on the hunt for new narrative forms that can cross media platforms, embracing new audiences all over the world.
