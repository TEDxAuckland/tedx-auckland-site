:item_title: Only house the holy | Mohamed Hassan | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. A storyteller at heart, Mohamed's poetry uses characters, narratives
  and humour to explore identity and society.\n\nMohamed Hassan is a spoken word poet
  and journalist from Cairo, Egypt. He has spent the majority of his life in Auckland,
  navigating the spaces between two cultures and languages. A storyteller at heart,
  his poetry uses characters, narratives and humour to explore identity and society.
  He strongly believes in the power of poetry to build foundations for young people
  to speak and be heard. He is the winner of the Rising Voices Youth Poetry Slam 2013,
  and has been performing across Auckland stages for three years. He is part of a
  young collective of poets called the Waxed Poetic Revival.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/mhassan_1\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/waxedpoeticrevival\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
