  the TED Conferences. Luke turned his back on a successful advertising career to
  follow his passion for making things. His TV idea is now a worldwide success.\n\nAdman-turned-filmmaker
  Luke Nola is founder of Luke Nola & Friends, an Auckland-based production company
  that creates and produces award-winning television formats that inspire, engage
  and educate kids all over the world.\r\n\r\nOne of the most enduring formats produced
  is Let’s Get Inventin’, a multi-award-winning reality TV series featuring kids aged
  8-14 years with amazing invention ideas competing to build their contraptions.  The
  series is enjoyed throughout the world, screening in over 73 countries and is the
  first New Zealand children’s TV format ever to be licensed by the BBC in the UK.\r\n\r\nwww.lukenola.tv\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
