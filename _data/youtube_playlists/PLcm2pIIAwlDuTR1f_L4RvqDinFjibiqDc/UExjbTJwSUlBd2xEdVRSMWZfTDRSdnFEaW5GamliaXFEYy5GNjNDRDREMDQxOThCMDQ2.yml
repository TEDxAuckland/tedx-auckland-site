:item_title: Collective flow | John Boone | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. Rhythm Interactive is an interactive percussion experience.\n\nLeaving
  New Zealand in 1996 to go on his big OE, John returned to New Zealand with an exciting
  idea - to set up an interactive percussion business for the corporate events industry.
  In 2003 Rhythm Interactive was born, and it has grown to become one of the most
  innovative, interactive, and entertaining team building shows for the conference
  and events market in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nSince then, John has travelled throughout
  Australasia and Asia performing for thousands of people of all ages.\r\n\r\nIn 2009,
  the show won the category of Best Nationwide Corporate Entertainment at the Corporate
  Events Guide Peopleâ€™s Choice Awards.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized
  event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized
  events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event,
  TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection
  in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
  independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance
  for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject
  to certain rules and regulations)"
