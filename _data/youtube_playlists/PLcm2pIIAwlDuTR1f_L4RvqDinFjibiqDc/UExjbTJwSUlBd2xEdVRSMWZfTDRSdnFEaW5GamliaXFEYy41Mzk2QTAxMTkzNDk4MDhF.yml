:item_title: Invention rewired | David Downs & Jon Bridges | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. New Zealand prides itself on its ingenuity and an ability to
  solve problems with very limited resources. In their talk, Jon Bridges and David
  Downs suggest that this \"number 8 wire\" mentality is overdue for a rethink.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.no8rewired.kiwi/\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com/\n\nDavid
  Downs and Jon Bridges are serial co-authors, stretching right back to a time before
  email. After leaving university, they began their careers together in comedy, starring
  in comedy programme Away Laughing. After co-founding Auckland’s Classic Comedy Club
  their careers diverged. David went all corporate - working for Microsoft both here
  and in Asia before entering the public service, while Jon has been a presenter,
  writer, director and producer of TV and is also a sought-after MC and public speaker.\r\n\r\nWhile
  researching No.8 Re-wired, a compendium and celebration of New Zealand inventions
  which will be published by Penguin in September 2014, David and Jon became convinced
  that New Zealand’s pathway to achieving productivity matching that of our international
  peers lies through a rewiring of our famous No.8 Wire innovation mind-set.\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
