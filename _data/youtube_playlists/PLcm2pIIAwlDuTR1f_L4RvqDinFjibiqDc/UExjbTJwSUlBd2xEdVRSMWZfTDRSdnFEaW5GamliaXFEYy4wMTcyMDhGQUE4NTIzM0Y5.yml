:item_title: Borrowing courage | Muskan Devta | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. At just 14 years old, Muskan has published two books and hosts
  her own radio show, despite being born with several serious medical conditions.\n\nMuskan
  Devta is a bright, bubbly, and brave fourteen-year-old who has achieved much in
  her short life. Muskan was born with a medical condition called partial hemiplegia.
  Her right side is weaker than her left and for 13 years she had to wear a brace
  to keep her foot straight. Being a special needs child gave her a lot of challenges,
  but Muskan proved that she could overcome them by focusing on the positives.\r\n\r\nComing
  to New Zealand at age 4, Muskan is currently a student of Westlake Girls High School.
  She has been an radio host, column writer and author of two books, including her
  autobiography written to raise funds for Starship Hospital; the book ‘I Dream’ is
  now part of her school’s Year 9 curriculum. With the support of her family, school,
  and hospital, Muskan is very successful today. She is on a journey to make people
  realise that being a child with a disability does not mean you are different.\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
