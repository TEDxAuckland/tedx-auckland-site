  in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors globally over the last decade,
  this is one kiwi that is making her mark on the global stage.\r\n\r\nA systems thinker
  and scientist, she finds leverage points which, when activated, result in high impact,
  transformative and scalable models for individuals, business, cities and entire
  countries.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas
  worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people
  together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live
  speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These
  local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized
  TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
  individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"
