:item_title: Beyond the zero waste restaurant | Matt Stone | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. Matt explains how he reduces waste in his restaurants to zero
  and in turn makes the food, eco system and community better.\n\nArguably one of
  the hottest chefs on the Australian dining scene, it’s not rare for foodie fans
  of Matt’s to book tables 3-months in advance at Sydney’s Stanley St. Merchants where
  he’s head chef, or queue 100m down the street at Greenhouse, a Perth eatery which
  was named Restaurant of the Year in 2010.\r\n\r\nMatt’s an Aussie that’s serious
  about food and sustainability - if it can’t be sourced locally, it’s not on the
  menu. Greenhouse, Australia’s first all-recycled restaurant is a place where foodies
  can touch natural materials, understand where everyday fresh food comes from and
  taste food straight from the garden.\r\n\r\nWhen Matt’s not in the kitchen, he’s
  a regular face on TV and billboards, enthralling audiences on MasterChef Australia,
  Iron Chef Australia, and on his own TV show, Aussie Recipes that Rock, a series
  that is aired in over 40 countries.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Australian Gourmet Traveller
  named him Best New Talent.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized event In the
  spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events
  that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks
  video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small
  group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently
  organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program,
  but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"
