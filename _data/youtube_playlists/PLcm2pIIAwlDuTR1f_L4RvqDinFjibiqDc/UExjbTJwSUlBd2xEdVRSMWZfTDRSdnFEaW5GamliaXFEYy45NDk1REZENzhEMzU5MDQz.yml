:item_title: Garden to table | Catherine Bell | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. Catherine hopes that through the Garden to Table Trust, children
  can go up knowing the basic skills of growing and cooking their own food, reducing
  waste and chemicals in their diets and the environment.\n\nCatherineâ€™s mission in
  life is to inspire people to cook and eat simple, good food. A passionate foodie
  and Dish Magazine co-founder, Catherine is behind the Garden to Table Trust, a programme
  established to teach children aged 7-10 years how to grow, harvest, cook and share
  food.\r\n\r\nThe programme ticks all the boxes that Catherine feels are important
  in the world right now: caring for and about the natural world, knowing where food
  comes from and how to produce it, and knowing how to feed ourselves and our families.\r\n\r\nCatherine
  hopes that through the Garden to Table Trust, children can go up knowing the basic
  skills, reduce waste, eliminate plastic and chemicals, and eat only fresh food.\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
