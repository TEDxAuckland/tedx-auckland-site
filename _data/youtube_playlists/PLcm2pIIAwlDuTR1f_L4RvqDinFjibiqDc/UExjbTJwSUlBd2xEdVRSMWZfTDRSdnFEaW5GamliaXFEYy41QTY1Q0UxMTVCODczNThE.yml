  Sarah Longbottom is Creative Director of the Nga Rangatahi Toa Creative Arts Iniatiative in South Auckland, a mentoring and transition programme that connects top creative talent of Aotearoa with young people in alternative education. Sarah honed and flexed her agentic self in mainstream and residential youth justice classrooms, and was instrumental in the development of nationwide pedagogical leadership in alternative education. Both the excellence and inadequacies of our education system inspired Sarah to take her learnings and develop an innovative model of youth development based on the core values of love and acceptance, energy and creativity, and collaboration and community.

  About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
