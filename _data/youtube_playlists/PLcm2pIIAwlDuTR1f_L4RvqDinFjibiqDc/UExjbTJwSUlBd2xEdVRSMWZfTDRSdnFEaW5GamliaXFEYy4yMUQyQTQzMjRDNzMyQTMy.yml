:item_title: Growing through cancer | Rebecca Wadey | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. Rebecca has embraced a lifestyle of wellbeing as well as connecting
  with and supporting other women facing cancer. A chance friendship with raw foods
  “unbakery” Little Bird founder Megan May, buying a Vitamix and the essential addition
  of yoga marked a turning point in Rebecca’s journey and she has recently opened
  a yoga and wellness hub in Auckland. The Centre combines yoga, naturopathy, meditation,
  massage, acupuncture and nutrition and offers free programmes for women with cancer.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.the-centre.co.nz\r\nhttp://tedxauckland.com\n\nRebecca
  Wadey is a writer, fashion PR specialist, cancer survivor, mother and business founder.
  Since her diagnosis of breast cancer at 26, Rebecca has embraced a lifestyle of
  wellbeing as well as connecting with and supporting other women facing the disease.
  A chance friendship with raw foods “unbakery” Little Bird founder Megan May, buying
  a Vitamix and the essential addition of yoga marked a turning point in Rebecca’s
  journey and she has recently opened a yoga and wellness hub in Auckland. The Centre
  combines yoga, naturopathy, meditation, massage, acupuncture and nutrition and offers
  free programmes for women with cancer.\n\nAbout TEDx, x = independently organized
  event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized
  events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event,
  TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection
  in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x =
  independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance
  for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject
