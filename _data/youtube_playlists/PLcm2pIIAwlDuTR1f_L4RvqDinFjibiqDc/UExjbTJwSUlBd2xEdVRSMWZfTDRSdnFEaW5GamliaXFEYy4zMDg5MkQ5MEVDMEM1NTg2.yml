:item_title: The christmas tree and the universe | Richard Easther | TEDxAuckland
:description: "This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of
  the TED Conferences. Richard’s work focuses on the physics of the very early universe
  and understanding the ways in which the universe changes between the Big Bang and
  the present day.\n\nRichard Easther grew up in New Zealand and was educated at the
  University of Canterbury. After graduating with his PhD in 1994, Richard held post-doctoral
  fellowships at Waseda University in Japan and at Brown and Columbia Universities
  in the United States. Richard was a professor at Yale University from 2004 until
  the end of 2011, when he returned to New Zealand.\r\n\r\nRichard is now a professor
  and Head of the Department of Physics here at the University of Auckland. Richard’s
  work focuses on the physics of the very early universe and understanding the ways
  in which the universe changes between the Big Bang and the present day.\n\nAbout
  TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading,
  TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to
  share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.*
